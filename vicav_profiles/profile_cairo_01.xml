            <p>The Egyptian varieties of Arabic form a quite diversified
              linguistic group. They are usually subdivided into four major
              subgroups: the dialects of Upper Egypt, Middle Egypt, Lower Egypt
              and those spoken in the Oases. The dialect of the capital belongs
              to the northern group.</p>

            <p>By contrast to most other varieties of vernacular Arabic, the
              dialect of Cairo has been reduced to writing as well. There exists
              quite a significant amount of literary output, in particular stage
              plays.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>The first serious reliable descriptions of Egyptian Arabic were
              written in the 19th century: Wilhelm Spitta published his 
              <ref target="bibl:spitta_bey_1880_0000">grammar</ref> in 1880
              (which can be <ref target="https://archive.org/details/grammatikdesara00spitgoog">read 
              online at the Internet Archive</ref>) and Vollers’ 
              <ref target="bibl:vollers_1890_0000]">textbook in 1890</ref> 
              (<ref target="bibl:vollers_1895_0000]">English translation 1895</ref>, 
              available at the <ref target="https://archive.org/details/cu31924026886816">Internet
              Archive</ref>). These were followed by <ref target="bibl:nallino_1900_0000">Nallino 
              (1900)</ref> (full
              text at the <ref target="https://archive.org/details/laraboparlatoine00nalluoft">Internet Archive</ref>)

                Archive</ref>).</p>

            <p>The great bulk of publications was written after World War II.
              Interesting information was provided by <ref target="bibl:mitchell_1956_0000">Mitchell 
              (1956)</ref>, <ref target="bibl:tomiche_1964_0000">Tomiche (1962)</ref> and 
              <ref target="bibl:salib_1987_0000">Salib (1981)</ref>. Most studies
              followed rather traditional approaches. An exception is 
              <ref target="bibl:wise_1972_0000">Wise’s transformational grammar
              (1975)</ref>. Another very informative monography is Parkinson’s
              socio-linguistic study on <ref target="bibl:parkinson_1985_0000">terms 
              of address in Egyptian Arabic (1985)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The most substantial scholarly contributions to our knowledge of
              the Egyptian dialects were made by the German dialectologists Behnstedt 
              and Woidich. Most of their work was done in the 80’s and 90’s of 
              the 20th century. Woidich’s <ref target="bibl:woidich_2006_0001">grammar 
              (2006) of Cairo Arabic </ref>is the so far most comprehensive in-depth study of this
              variety.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="dictionaries">
            <p>There exist several dictionaries for those who want to study
              Egyptian Arabic. The hitherto most comprehensive one is 
              <ref target="bibl:hinds_badawi_1986_0000">Hinds/Badawi
                (Arabic-English)</ref>. It was published in 1986. </p>

            <p>
              <ref target="bibl:spiro_1895_0000">Socrates Spiro’s dictionary
              (1895)</ref> is pretty old. As there is not much available in
              digital form, it is still worth looking at. To access an online
              reading interface made up of digital images

            <p>VICAV also provides a small digital dictionary of Cairo Arabic.
              It primarily serves didactic purposes. You can access it

          <div type="textBooks">
            <p>For generations of learners of spoken Egyptian the course
              material compiled by <ref target="bibl:abdel_massih_egypt">Abdel-Massih 
              (1978-9)</ref> was the main guidance. A more
              up-to-date textbook is Woidich/Heinen’s 
              <ref target="bibl:woidich_heinen_nasr_2004_0000">Kullu tamām!
              (2004)</ref>. Furthermore, a graded series of textbooks by 
              <ref target="bibl:louis_2008_">Samia Louis</ref> has to be
              mentioned. In these books, all the reading material is presented
              in the Arabic script. In addition, they come with high quality
              CDs.</p>

            <p>Two German textbooks should also be highlighted: Woidich’s 
              <ref target="bibl:woidich_2002_0000">Ahlan wa Sahlan (2002)</ref>
              actually predates his Kullu tamām!. The sesond one is Ahmed’s 
              <ref target="bibl:ahmed_1983_0000">Lehrbuch des
              Ägyptisch-Arabischen (1981)</ref> which unfortunately contains
              countless typos. Nevertheless, the texts collected there are very
              helpful, especially for advanced learners.</p>

            <p>Until the late twentieth century, the language of the Egyptian
              capital remained poorly documented. Meanwhile, a number of
              valuable descriptions have been published. The amount of 
              <ref target="bibl:geo:Cairo">publications dealing with the variety of
