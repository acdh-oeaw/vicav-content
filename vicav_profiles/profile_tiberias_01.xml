            <p>Tiberias is a small town in lower Galilee at the shores of the
              Sea of Galilee, which in Arabic is named after the city Buḥayrat
              Ṭabariyya. It is both a touristic and economic centre of the
              region. Furthermore, the city plays an important role in Judaism
              and for a long time the large Jewish population lived side by side
              with the Muslim Arabs of that place. In 1948 the Arab population
              of Tiberias was driven out of the city, but there is a – albeit
              rapidly decreasing – number of Jews with Arabic as their mother
              tongue. The dialect therefore can be regarded as a highly
              endangered variety, because it will probably fade with the death
              of the current generation of its speakers.</p>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>A very detailed and substantial study on the Judeo-Arabic dialect
              of Tiberias was done by <ref target="bibl:geva-kleinberger_2009_3208">Geva-Kleinberger
                (2009)</ref>, who examined the features of this dialect and
              especially its autochthonous phrases on the basis of numerous
              recorded and transcribed texts, mainly by elderly people who have
              kept their dialect over the decades. A preliminary study of this
              work with only one sample text is <ref target="bibl:geva_kleinberger_2004_0000">Geva-Kleinberger
                2004</ref>. Even though already at the beginning of the 20th
              century the dialect area of Palestine has been examined, there is
              no dictionary or grammatical study on Tiberias. Nevertheless one
              can find some data in Bergsträsser’s <hi rend="italic">Sprachatlas</hi>
              <hi rend="italic"> von </hi>
              <hi rend="italic">Syrien</hi>
              <hi rend="italic"> und </hi>
              <hi rend="italic">Palästina</hi> 1915 (location no. 36). He did
              not include transcribed texts of that, but from numerous maps, one
              can extract different dialectal features that were used by the
              (Muslim) speakers of Tiberias.</p>
