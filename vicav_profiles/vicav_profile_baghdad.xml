            </div>

            <div type="general">
               <p>The dialect of the Iraqi capital can be regarded as the prestige variety of
                  the whole country. It is frequently used in the media and widely understood not only in Iraq, but
                  also in the adjacent Gulf region, in Eastern Syria, and in the Iranian province of Khuzestan. The
                  linguistic setting of Baghdad is special for its so-called “communal
                  dialects”. The current prestige variety (described here) is actually the dialect which until
                  fairly recently was spoken solely by the Muslim population. The Christian and
                  Jewish (no longer in Iraq) inhabitants of Baghdad speak a very different dialect of
                  the so-called <hi rendition="#i">qǝltu</hi> type, which is much closer to Northern Iraq and
                  not influenced by Bedouin features.</p>
            </div>

            <div type="researchHistory">

               <p>The first comprehensive descriptions of the Arabic dialect of Baghdad did
                  not appear before the 1960s. Before that only some very brief remarks (<rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:PPUJCX35">Jeannier (1888)</rs>,
                  <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:EG67QXCT">Massignon (1912)</rs>) and a few textbooks and glossaries
                  were published, particularly Van Ess 1917 (second edition 1938, many <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:BKRGRGZL">reprints</rs> until 1989) and van
                  Wagoner 1949, but both contain a mixture of various Iraqi dialects and cannot be
                  regarded as dialectological descriptions. The first scholarly monographs published
                  were <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:Z9QMK224">Malaika 1963</rs> and <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:BMI8BKRI">Erwin 1963</rs>,
                  shortly followed by <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DJXKPUNA">Blanc 1964</rs>. Blanc, who coined the term “communal dialects”,
                  presented a rather concise but excellent description of Muslim, Christian, and
                  Jewish Baghdadi. <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:7HXLWVN3">Abu-Haidar 1991 </rs> deals
                  with the Christian variety. <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:K5KFYH5L">Palva 2009</rs> convincingly
                  argues that the Bedouin (= <hi rendition="#i">gilit</hi> type) character of present-day Muslim
                  Baghdadi is mainly the result of a process of bedouinization during the past 300 years. Thus,
                  for a considerable time after the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258, the dialect of Baghdad had
                  remained to be an urban Mesopotamian type dialect that has only slowly changed due to immigration from the
                  countryside. In spite of its importance, Baghdad Arabic has not been intensively studied (compared
                  to, e.g., Cairo or Damascus) and almost all reference works date back to the 1960s.
                  A concise grammatical sketch of the dialect is “Baghdad Arabic” (Abu-Haidar 2006),
                  in <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:AZIMWCKB">EALL I, 222-231</rs>.</p>
