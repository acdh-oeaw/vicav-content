            <div type="general">
               <p>Jordanian dialects have until recently remained a widely neglected area in the field of Arabic dialectology.</p>
               <p>The linguistic situation is - due to the city’s and countries history - a
               very special one and cannot be investigated without taking a closer look at it.
               Before Amman was announced the capital of Jordan in 1921, it was a
               rather small and unimportant village inhabited by 5000 Circassian migrants,
               who settled there because they were forced to leave their homeland in the course of the Russo-Circassian War.</p>

               <p>In recent decades, the city experienced fast growth as many Jordanians left their villages
                  and moved to the capital. In addition, many Palestinian and Syrian merchant families settled in Amman. </p>
               <p>In default of a real local alternative, they were all using the dialects of their hometowns. </p>
               <p>Amman also received influxes of refugees from other Arab countries:</p>
               <p>During the Arab-Israeli War in 1948 and the Six-Day War in 1967 many
                  Palestinian refugees arrived in Amman. Because of the Gulf War in 1991
                  and the invasion of Iraq in 2003 many Iraqis and Kuwaitis settled in the
                  city. The most recent migration wave started with the Syrian civil war in 2011.</p>

               <p>Young people in Amman started calling themselves <hi rendition="#i">ʕammāniyīn</hi> (inhabitants of Amman) –
               a word that has not been in use before, indicating that this generation is actually the first one feeling native to the city and starting to create Amman’s koiné. </p>
               <p>Research has shown that Jordanian dialects and urban Palestinian dialects are the most influential ones in the process of koineization. </p>

            <div type="researchHistory">
               <p>There is no detailed grammatical description of Amman Arabic available right now.</p>
               <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:7J9JM94A">Al-Wer (2007, EALL)</rs> is a concise linguistic sketch giving an overview
               about the most common features. Sawaie (EALL) provides further information
               on the history of Jordan, its linguistic situation as well as a short sketch of important research. </p>

               <p>Most of the research has had a major focus on the dialect’s phonology:</p>
               <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:L8X448R5">Al-Wer (2002)</rs> is dealing with the
               first generation considering themselves as native Ammanis (<hi rendition="#i">ʕammāniyīn</hi>) and the set of consonants and vowels they are using in their speech.</p>
               <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:V35M353C">Al-Wer (2003)</rs> is a study on the
               pronunciation of the 2nd person plural pronominal suffix. It
               is a diachronic study as she is describing the development of its pronunciation in three successive generations of Amman.</p>
               <p>A further article of <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:CBZND4FV">Al-Wer (2007)</rs> can be seen as a summary of
               the two previous topics. In her introduction she gives concise
               information on the dialect situation of Amman in an interwoven manner
               with the city’s history. The article therefore is a good way to get a first insight on the linguistic situation in Amman.</p>
               <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:SMK2SIMI">Abdel-Jawad (1986)</rs> examines
               the emergence of urban dialects in Amman and Irbid providing
               sociophonetic information. His PhD thesis is an investigation on
               lexical and phonological variation in Amman. (The full text is available <ref target="https://search.proquest.com/docview/303188711">here</ref>.)</p>

               <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:X7EEJJAC">Zawaydeh (1998)</rs> as well
               as <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:GK7CAGI4">Zawaydeh and de Jong (2011)</rs> focus on the phenomena of uvularization in Ammani Arabic.</p>

               <p>Heselwood and al-Tamimi have undertaken two phonetic studies:
               The first is dealing with laryngeal and pharyngeal consonants <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:2S94J7B9">(2011)</rs> and
               the second with plain and emphatic coronals <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:9GSGWHBE">(2011)</rs>.</p>

               <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:QT3T2V7U">Prokosch (1991)</rs> lists
               Ottoman Turkish loanwords in Ammani Arabic. <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:M9U8P6V5">Zibin
               and Al-Tkhayneh (2019)</rs> is a sociolinguistic analysis of the use
               of English loanwords inflected with Arabic morphemes – features that are mostly used by young people as a slang language. </p>
