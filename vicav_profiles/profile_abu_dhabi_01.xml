            <p>Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates and its
              second largest city. Until the mid-20th century Abu Dhabi was a
              small town of less than 25,000 inhabitants, but has grown rapidly
              in the following decades reaching one million in the early 2000s.
              However, only a small proportion of its inhabitants are native
              speakers of the local Arabic dialect. </p>
