               <p>During the past few years, Aleppo has been notorious as one of the worst-hit regions of the persistent Syrian civil war, suffering devastation and an immense number of causalities and fatalities. </p>
               <p>The city has a long history. It is considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban centres in the world, being a settled site for over 5000 years.</p>
               <p>Because of its location at the western terminus of the Silk Road, Aleppo has always been an important trade centre. Under Ottoman rule it became the administrative capital of a province that included parts of Syria and Turkey, and was one of the strategic strongholds of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
               <p>After the First World War and the rather random drawing of new borders, Aleppo’s trade ties with important surrounding cities got weaker. However, its manufacturing sector survived and flourished an the city became a thriving industrial centre rivalling Syria’s capital Damascus.</p>
               <p>Aleppo is especially famous for its olive oil soap, which is, despite the difficulties of war, still being produced. </p>
