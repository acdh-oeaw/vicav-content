               <p>The Egyptian varieties of Arabic form a quite diversified
                  linguistic group. They are usually subdivided into four major
                  subgroups: the dialects of Upper Egypt, Middle Egypt, Lower Egypt
                  and those spoken in the Oases. The dialect of the capital belongs
                  to the northern group.</p>
               <p>By contrast to most other varieties of vernacular Arabic, the
                  dialect of Cairo has been reduced to writing as well. There exists
                  quite a significant amount of literary output, in particular stage
                  plays.</p>

            <div type="researchHistory">
               <p>The first serious reliable descriptions of Egyptian Arabic were
                  written in the 19th century: Wilhelm Spitta published his
                  <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:G3NGRC2E">grammar</rs> in 1880
                  (which can be <ref target="https://archive.org/details/grammatikdesara00spitgoog">read

                  (<rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:8RP2NLSP">English translation 1895</rs>,

                     Archive</ref>). These were followed by <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:ZK8JBU8G">Nallino
                     (1900)</rs> (full

                     Archive</ref>).</p>
               <p>The great bulk of publications was written after World War II.
                  Interesting information was provided by <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DLFC8LUQ">Mitchell
                     (1956)</rs>, <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:Z592GTRW">Tomiche (1964)</rs> and
                  <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:QEEWK83P">Salib (1981)</rs>. Most studies
                  followed rather traditional approaches. An exception is
                  <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:FTSGHYMH">Wise’s transformational grammar
                     (1975)</rs>. Another very informative monography is Parkinson’s
                  socio-linguistic study on terms
                     of address in Egyptian Arabic <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:HAB8VRQG">(Parkinson 1985)</rs>.</p>
               <p>The most substantial scholarly contributions to our knowledge of
                  the Egyptian dialects were made by the German dialectologists Behnstedt
                  and Woidich. Most of their work was done in the 80’s and 90’s of
                  the 20th century. Woidich’s <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:3QNH63BL">grammar
                     (2006) of Cairo Arabic </rs>is the so far most comprehensive in-depth study of this
                  variety.</p>

            <div type="dictionaries">
               <p>There exist several dictionaries for those who want to study
                  Egyptian Arabic. The hitherto most comprehensive one is
                  <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:VSM7I4KA">Hinds/Badawi
                     (Arabic-English)</rs>. It was published in 1986. </p>

                  digital form, it is still worth looking at. To access an online

                  mentioned. In these books, all the reading material is presented

                  CDs.</p>
               <p>Two German textbooks should also be highlighted: Woidich’s

                     Ägyptisch-Arabischen (1981)</rs> which unfortunately contains
                  countless typos. Nevertheless, the texts collected there are very
