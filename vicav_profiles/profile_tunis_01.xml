          <div type="general">
            <p>The Arabic dialect of Tunis as spoken today by the majority of
              the city’s inhabitants is a contact variety influenced by a vast
              population influx from all over Tunisia during the 20th century.
              It can be regarded as a prestige variety since speakers of other
              Tunisian Arabic dialects tend to shift towards it. Tunis Arabic is
              widely used in oral and visual media (theater, film, slogans). It
              is, however, rarely written except in informal letters, newspaper
              cartoons or advertising slogans.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>The first description of the dialect of the city of Tunis can be
              found in the then ground-breaking study by <ref target="bibl:stumme_1896_0001">Stumme 1896</ref>, which he
              published after his <ref target="bibl:stumme_1893_0000">edition
                of transcribed texts (Stumme 1893)</ref>. The variety spoken by
              the Jews of Tunis is described by <ref target="bibl:cohen_1975_0000">Cohen 1975</ref>. The most
              detailed description of Tunis Arabic so far is <ref target="bibl:singer_1984_0000">Singer 1984</ref>, a monumental
              grammar of the dialect spoken in the Medina of Tunis in the early
              1960s. Aspects of the syntax are investigated by <ref target="bibl:jemni_2011_0000">Jemni 2011</ref>, important
              sociolinguistic studies are <ref target="bibl:gibson_1998_0000">Gibson 1998</ref> and Gibson 2012.</p>
            <p>A concise grammatical sketch of the Arabic dialect of Tunis is
              Maik Gibson’s “Tunis Arabic” in EALL IV, 563-571.</p>

          <div type="dictionaries">
            <p>A comprehensive up-to-date dictionary of the Arabic dialect of
              Tunis does not exist.</p>

              <ref target="bibl:nicolas_1911_0000">Nicolas 1911</ref> is
              outdated and does not provide an appropriate transcription.</p>
            <p>Beaussier/Lentin 2006 contains words from the whole Maghreb
              including data on Tunis.</p>
            <p>Abdellatif's Dictionnaire «le Karmous» du Tunisien (2010) is a
              rather useful amateur glossary and can currently be downloaded
              from <ref target="https://www.fichier-pdf.fr/2010/08/31/m14401m/dico-karmous.pdf">this URI</ref>.</p>
            <p>In addition, the <ref target="bibl:marcais_guiga_1958_61_0000">eight volume glossary compiled by Marçais/Guîga 1958-61</ref>
              that covers the vocabulary of the village of Takrouna (ca.100 km
              south-east of Tunis) is very useful for Tunis Arabic, too.</p>
            <p>A large <ref target="bibl:abdelkader_1977_0001">English-Tunisian Arabic dictionary is Ben Abdelkader [et al.]
                1977 </ref> which can be downloaded from <ref target="http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED183017.pdf">this

            <p>An example for a contemporary musician from Tunis, who is singing
              in the Arabic dialect of Tunis, is Amel Mathlouthi. Many of her
