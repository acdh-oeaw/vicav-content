          <p>East (Mashreq) › Levant › Palestine</p>
          <p>Today, the Ramallah dialect shares many features with other urban 
              centres of the region and shows only few traces of the original rural 
              Palestinian variety.</p>
        </div>

        <div type="general">
          <p>Ramallah is a city in the West Bank and the administrative centre of the 
              Palestinian Authority. Originally a predominantly Christian town, it has 
              merged with neighbouring al-Bireh, which is predominantly Muslim, to form 
              the municipality of Ramallah–al-Bireh. Most often, al-Bireh is subsumed when 
              speaking of Ramallah.</p>
          <p>Today, Ramallah’s population is mostly Sunni Muslim, also due to an increase 
              in population and the opening of refugee camps since 1948. The city has urban 
              characteristic such as a social heterogeneity of the population, despite the 
              population being little over 60,000 people, and boasts a middle class that is 
              part of a globalist, modernist élite.</p>
          <p>Ramallah’s Christian identity is stressed despite the fact that the majority of 
              its population is actually Muslim, and restaurants can obtain alcohol licenses 
              there, but not in adjacent al-Bireh. Christians are believed to be less socially 
              conservative, and Ramallah’s Christian character is invoked to explain the lack 
              of social conservativism, an explanation not fully in line with the facts.</p>
          <p>Because of its sunny and mild climate, it used to be a popular summer resort and 
              wealthy citizens and tourists built houses there.</p>
          <p>Seeger (dialect-)geographically locates Ramallah as a part of Jabal al-Quds, an 
              Ottoman district that did not belong to a specific tribe. The old in Ramallah 
              and al-Bireh stress that they are not affiliated to any “Banī Fulān”, i.e. they 
              are not part of any tribe.</p>
          <p>Even though it is historically a rural community, today an urban dialect is spoken 
              in Ramallah. This is attributed to people from Lidd and Ramle moving to Ramallah 
              in 1948, when the State of Israel was founded and many Arabs were forced to leave 
              their homes. The deeper layers of dialect in Ramallah are probably similar to the 
              dialects of the villages surrounding it. One of the distinctive features of the 
              urban type is the final Imāla of the feminine ending <hi rendition="#i">(-a &gt; -e)</hi>. The pronominal 
              suffix 3rd person sing. masc. is <hi rendition="#i">-e</hi> in Ramallah, but not raised in the villages 
              (e.g. <hi rendition="#i">bēte</hi> “his house” in Ramallah, but <hi rendition="#i">bēta</hi> in the villages). According to 
              <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DFAEW2X9">Seeger 2009</rs>, this could be a remainder of a communal Christian dialect in the area. 
              Interesting is the personal pronoun 3rd pers. pl. in Ramallah: <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DFAEW2X9">Seeger 2009</rs> 
              describes <hi rendition="#i">hinne</hi> only for Ramallah, but not al-Bireh. This pronoun, different 
              from MSA <hi rendition="#i">hum</hi> (masc.) / <hi rendition="#i">hunna</hi> (fem.) is shared with many Syrian and Lebanese dialects.</p>
          <p>The process of linguistic levelling is sped up the youth’s preference for urban prestige 
              varieties. The contact with Hebrew speakers is marginal in Ramallah, and loans play 
              a very limited role.</p>
        </div>

        <div type="researchHistory">
          <p>A pioneering work on the Palestinian dialects, urban and rural, is <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:GJ9VKTBU">Bauer 1926</rs>. A 
              dissertation by <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:5PAG6FAF">Abu Nahleh 1985</rs> deals with object clitics and pronouns in the Ramallah 
              dialect. <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:IG9J8PQJ">Cadora 1992</rs> examines the process of urbanization in Ramallah and how it affects 
              the speech of its inhabitants.</p>

          <p>The rural dialects of the central West Bank are described in much detail by 
             <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DFAEW2X9">Seeger 2009</rs>, <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:RWEPYBN7">Shachmon 2011</rs>, 
             <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:78DY5UVW">Shachmon 2013a</rs>, <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DBVEXYIT">Shachmon 2013b</rs>, 
            and <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:WHGASK8Y">Shachmon 2018</rs>, 
             as well as <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:5MISXMEC">Shachmon 2021</rs> but conclusions about Ramallah itself 
             can only be drawn by contrast. The dialect substrate of the city, however, 
             is certainly similar to the dialects of the surrounding villages.</p>
        </div>

        <div type="dictionaries">
          <p><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:GRD3QE3C">Bauer’s 1957</rs> is still a helpful source for Palestinian Colloquial (Arabic-German). 
              <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:6XVCYDUK">Barthélemy</rs> with the supplement by Denizeau is unparalleled as a dictionary of the 
              colloquial of the area. Al-Barghuti is an Arabic-Arabic dictionary, whereas 
              <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:U5IXMTFU">Elihai 1973</rs> and <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:NGFE3X6J">Elihai 2004</rs> 
            are an Arabic-French and a learner’s dictionary, respectively.</p>

        <div type="textBooks">
          <p>There are no textbooks dealing with the dialect of Ramallah specifically, but
            a good learner’s resource is <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:PZE96FG5">Halloun and Seeger 2001</rs> (German-Arabic) with a
            second volume published in <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:PI8ZCGB5">2006</rs>, which is sensitive to dialectal differences. 
            <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:RIHSGP4D">Seeger 2013</rs> is a textbook on urban Palestinian Arabic. <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:3H34X7YQ">Elihai 2011</rs> is a 
            classic for learners of Palestinan Arabic (English-Arabic).</p>
