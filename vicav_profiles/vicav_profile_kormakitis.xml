               <p xml:space="preserve">Kormakitis is a village in Northern Cyprus where a peripheral variety of Arabic is spoken. 
                        Cypriot Arabic is an endangered language, especially since the population of Kormakitis 
                        has largely dispersed or moved to Nicosia after the Turkish invasion in 1974. The total 
                        of speakers is approximately 1000 persons. Initiatives like <hi rendition="#i">Hki Fi Sanna</hi> (“Speak in our language”) 
                        try to revive this variety and transcribe this formerly non-literate language in Latin or 
                        Greek letters.</p>
               <p xml:space="preserve">The origin of Cypriot Arabic is believed to be Central-North Lebanese, although 
                        Borg 2004 argues for an Anatolian origin.</p>
               <p xml:space="preserve">Between the 7th and 13th centuries, Maronite Christians migrated from Syria and Lebanon 
                        to Cyprus.</p>
               <p xml:space="preserve">Speakers of this variety are without exception bilingual in Cypriot Greek and Cypriot Arabic 
                        and have been completely isolated from the influence of Classical Arabic for religious reasons, as well as from 
                        other Arabic dialects. This makes it an ideal subject for the study of language-internal changes. Interestingly, 
                        Greek forms follow Greek morphology and Arabic forms follow Arabic morphology, with mixed forms being rather 
                        rare. Greek has, however, had a great impact on phonology and syntax as well as lexicon.</p>

               <p xml:space="preserve"><rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:9JYT6K9T">Boustany 1957</rs> is the first scientific mention of the language spoken in Kormakiti. 
                        A sketch is found in <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:H9TV5UE6">Newton 1964</rs>. More data was provided in <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:6X4X7KZG">Tsiapera 1969</rs> 
                        though this work received much criticism (particularly by Jastrow and Borg) because of inadequate fieldwork methods and its linguistic 
                        shortcomings. Newton’s question if Cypriotic Arabic is a “mixed language” was affirmed in <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:DXPR99F3">Jastrow 1977</rs>, 
                        because communication in Cypriot Arabic without ad hoc loans from Greek seems to be impossible. Besides this observation, Jastrow draws 
                        parallels to Maltese, which also developed in an exclusively Christian community. The mixed-language thesis was not universally adopted. 
                        For a discussion of this, see <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:WB6LYCI4">Kossmann 2008</rs>.</p>

                        Borg <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:ZTEVYGKD">(1985)</rs> is a comprehensive monograph on Cypriot Arabic, which was later complimented by his articles 
                        on the parallels with Maltese <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:SDNWNF5I">(Borg 1994)</rs>, phonology <rs type="bibl" ref="zotid:ZTEVYGKD">(Borg 1997)</rs> and a comparative
