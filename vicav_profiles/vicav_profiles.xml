          </div>

          <div type="general">
            <p>The dialect of the capital of Syria is regarded as a very
              “elegant” variety of Arabic and has a very high prestige. It is
              frequently used in the media and increasingly also in films.
              Hence, Damascus Arabic is widely understood in whole Syria, in
              Lebanon, and even in Jordan and Palestine.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>Descriptions of the Arabic dialect of Damascus go back as far as
              the 18th century when the German orientalist and theologian Johann
              Heinrich Callenberg published his description of Damascus Arabic
              in Latin (<ref target="bibl:callenberg_1720_1740_0000">Callenberg 
              1720-1740</ref>). Collections of texts and short grammatical notes 
              were published at the end of the 19th and the first half of the 
              20th centuries (<ref target="bibl:huart_0000">Huart 1883</ref>, 
              <ref target="bibl:oestrup_1897_0000">Oestrup 1897</ref> [although 
              mostly not real Damascene
              dialect], <ref target="bibl:malinjoud_1924_0000">Malinjoud
                1924</ref>, Bergsträßer 1924, <ref target="bibl:saussey_1937_1938_0000">Saussey 1937-38</ref>),
              Cantineau 1956, Dietrich 1956) but the first comprehensive
              description of the dialect appeared only in the 1960s: Cowell
              1964, Grotzfeld 1964, Grotzfeld 1965, Ambros 1977. Today Damascus
              Arabic is certainly among the Arabic dialects which are best
              described. </p>
              
            <p>A concise grammatical sketch of the dialect is Jérôme Lentin’s
              “Damascus Arabic”, in EALL I, 546-555.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="dictionaries">
            <p>
              <ref target="bibl:barthelemy_1935_1954_0000">Barthélemy
                1935-54</ref> is still unmatched as the dictionary for Syrian
              Arabic, but it is mainly based on the dialect of Aleppo.
              Nevertheless it is extremely useful for Damascus Arabic too, as is
                <ref target="bibl:denizeau_1960_0000">Denizeau 1960</ref>.</p>
              
            <p>Very promising is the online-dictionary titled Dictionnaire
              d’arabe dialectal syrien (parler de Damas) by Claude Salamé &amp;
              Jérôme Lentin, although until now only the letter B has been
              published.</p>

          <div type="general">
            <p>The Egyptian varieties of Arabic form a quite diversified
              linguistic group. They are usually subdivided into four major
              subgroups: the dialects of Upper Egypt, Middle Egypt, Lower Egypt
              and those spoken in the Oases. The dialect of the capital belongs
              to the northern group.</p>

            <p>By contrast to most other varieties of vernacular Arabic, the
              dialect of Cairo has been reduced to writing as well. There exists
              quite a significant amount of literary output, in particular stage
              plays.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>The first serious reliable descriptions of Egyptian Arabic were
              written in the 19th century: Wilhelm Spitta published his 
              <ref target="bibl:spitta_bey_1880_0000">grammar</ref> in 1880
              (which can be <ref target="https://archive.org/details/grammatikdesara00spitgoog">read 
              online at the Internet Archive</ref>) and Vollers’ 
              <ref target="bibl:vollers_1890_0000]">textbook in 1890</ref> 
              (<ref target="bibl:vollers_1895_0000]">English translation 1895</ref>, 
              available at the <ref target="https://archive.org/details/cu31924026886816">Internet
              Archive</ref>). These were followed by <ref target="bibl:nallino_1900_0000">Nallino 
              (1900)</ref> (full
              text at the <ref target="https://archive.org/details/laraboparlatoine00nalluoft">Internet Archive</ref>)

                Archive</ref>).</p>

            <p>The great bulk of publications was written after World War II.
              Interesting information was provided by <ref target="bibl:mitchell_1956_0000">Mitchell 
              (1956)</ref>, <ref target="bibl:tomiche_1964_0000">Tomiche (1962)</ref> and 
              <ref target="bibl:salib_1987_0000">Salib (1981)</ref>. Most studies
              followed rather traditional approaches. An exception is 
              <ref target="bibl:wise_1972_0000">Wise’s transformational grammar
              (1975)</ref>. Another very informative monography is Parkinson’s

              of address in Egyptian Arabic (1985)</ref>.</p>

            <p>The most substantial scholarly contributions to our knowledge of
              the Egyptian dialects were made by the German dialectologists Behnstedt 
              and Woidich. Most of their work was done in the 80’s and 90’s of 
              the 20th century. Woidich’s <ref target="bibl:woidich_2006_0001">grammar 
              (2006) of Cairo Arabic </ref>is the so far most comprehensive in-depth study of this
              variety.</p>
          </div>

          <div type="dictionaries">
            <p>There exist several dictionaries for those who want to study
              Egyptian Arabic. The hitherto most comprehensive one is

          <div type="general">
            <p>The Arabic dialect of Tunis as spoken today by the majority of
              the city’s inhabitants is a contact variety influenced by a vast
              population influx from all over Tunisia during the 20th century.
              It can be regarded as a prestige variety since speakers of other
              Tunisian Arabic dialects tend to shift towards it. Tunis Arabic is
              widely used in oral and visual media (theater, film, slogans). It
              is, however, rarely written except in informal letters, newspaper
              cartoons or advertising slogans.</p>

              the impact of Bedouin infiltration mainly in the second half of

              assumed that the old dialect of Salé (as is stated for Rabat) had
              similar basic features as Tanger and Tetouan speech. The
              development from an „urban“ to a „mixed rural-urban“ dialect is

          <div type="general">
            <p>The town of Douz is one of the greatest oases in the so-called
              Nifzāwa region situated south-east of the Šaṭṭ al-Ǧarīd (Chott
              el-Jerid). Its dialect is more or less identical to the speech of
              the formerly semi-nomadic Maṛāzīg tribe which numbers around
              30,000 members. The Marzūgī dialect is an archaic variety of
              Maghrebinian Bedouin Arabic and exhibits features such as gender
              distinction with plural forms and internal passive voice (although
              of restricted use) with verbs. As a Bedouin dialect it is
              considered a low-variety by the speakers of sedentary dialects,
              e.g. of the capital Tunis, but highly appreciated by the Bedouins
              themselves. Only some young speakers show the tendency to
              accommodate to urban sedentary speech. With its rich lexicon it is
              the vehicle for popular poetry. As a representative of the Sulaym
              Group of Maghrebi Bedouin dialects it is widely understood in
              Libya and Eastern Algeria.</p>

              great number of articles dedicated to the language and culture of
              the Maṛāzīg (see below). A voluminous monograph which includes

              has been a regional trade centre for many centuries. Starting in
              the 1960s Sousse has developed into one of the country’s main
              Tourism destinations. This caused immense increase in population,
              especially migration from rural areas all over Tunisia, which has
              significantly influenced the original dialect.</p>

          <div type="general">
            <p>Because the official language of the region is Turkish, the
              Arabic dialect of the city of Urfa is a minority language. Similar
              varieties of Arabic are spoken in many villages and smaller towns
              (e.g. Harran and Akçakale) situated between Urfa and the Syrian
              border. Urfa Arabic is linguistically very close to the dialects
              of the sheep and goat breeding nomads (the so-called Shawāya) of
              the Syrian Steppe and arguably constitutes the northernmost
              variety of the Arabian Bedouin dialects. Tribal structures among
              the local Arabic speakers (estimated to be around 150,000) are
              still very strong, and the relatively strict endogamy results in a
              high proportion of first language speakers even among the youngest
              generation. Urfa Arabic is usually not written; but there are
              internet sites containing phrases, songs, and proverbs in
              vernacular Arabic written in Latin script.</p>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>Although the existence of Arabic speaking groups in the region
              has been known since at least the 19th century, the dialect is
              still poorly documented. A very short grammatical sketch is

          </div>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>The dialect of the Iraqi capital can be regarded as the prestige
              variety of the whole country. It is frequently used in the media
              and widely understood not only in Iraq, but also in the adjacent
              Gulf region, in Eastern Syria, and in the Iranian province of
              Khuzestan. The linguistic setting of Baghdad is special for its
              so-called “communal dialects”. The current prestige variety
              (described here) is actually the dialect which until fairly
              recently was spoken solely by the Muslim population. The Christian
              and Jewish (no longer in Iraq) inhabitants of Baghdad speak a very
              different dialect of the so-called <hi rend="italic">qǝltu</hi>
              type, which is much closer to Northern Iraq and not influenced by
              Bedouin features.</p>
            <p>The first comprehensive descriptions of the Arabic dialect of
              Baghdad did not appear before the 1960s. Before that only some
              very brief remarks (Jeannier 1888, Massignon 1912) and a few
              textbooks and glossaries were published, particularly Van Ess 1917
              (second edition 1938, many <ref target="bibl:van_ess_0000">reprints</ref> until 1989) and van Wagoner 1949, but both
              contain a mixture of various Iraqi dialects and cannot be regarded
              as dialectological descriptions. The first scholarly monographs
              published were <ref target="bibl:malaika_1963">Malaika
                1963</ref> and <ref target="bibl:erwin_1963_0001">Erwin
                1963</ref>, shortly followed by <ref target="bibl:blanc_1964_0001">Blanc 1964</ref>. Blanc, who
              coined the term “communal dialects”, presented a rather concise
              but excellent description of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish
              Baghdadi. <ref target="bibl:abu_haidar_1991_0001">Abu-Haider
                1991 </ref> deals with the Christian variety. <ref target="bibl:palva_2009_001">Palva 2009</ref> convincingly
              argues that the Bedouin (= gǝlǝt type) character of present-day
              Muslim Baghdadi is mainly the result of a process of
              bedouinization during the past 300 years. Thus, for a considerable
              time after the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258, the dialect of
              Baghdad had remained to be an urban Mesopotamian type dialect that
              has only slowly changed due to immigration from the countryside.
              In spite of its importance, Baghdad Arabic has not been
              intensively studied (compared to, e.g., Cairo or Damascus) and
              almost all reference works date back to the 1960s.</p>

            <p>Soukhne is a town located in the Syrian Steppe close to the
              eastern border of the province of Homs. The importance of the
              former caravan city increased throughout the centuries, when the
              town developed into a trade centre. Trade took place mostly
              between Bedouin tribes, for example the tribal confederation of
              ˁAnaza, and the local merchants. The town severely suffered from
              the civil war in Syria, particularly between 2015 and 2017 when it
              was under control of ISIS forces.</p>
            <p>Soukhne is described as a town with a dynamic history. Local
              merchants used to travel to various Syrian regions, but also to
              Iraq and Turkey and therefore adopted different linguistic
              elements that contributed to the shaping of the dialect of
              Soukhne. <ref target="bibl:behnstedt_1994_0001">Behnstedt

            <p>Ahwāz is the capital city of the southwestern Iranian province of

              million inhabitants Arabs are the biggest ethnic group, the second

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>Important data about the dialect comes from the Italian scholar

              Between <ref target="bibl:panetta_1980_0000">1958 and 1980</ref>
              she published phrases and words in a dictionary-like form

              different journals and books.</p>
            <p>The British linguist T.F. Mitchell dedicated two articles to the
              dialect of the Cyrenaica in which he also mentioned features of
              the dialect of Benghazi: <ref target="bibl:mitchell_1952_4586">

          <div type="general">
            <p>Taizz is located on the crossings of several main roads
              connecting it directly with Sanaa in the north, Aden in the south,
              and Mocha at the Red Sea. Hence, the local vernacular is strongly
              exposed to influences from other Yemeni dialects. This makes it
              difficult to identify a genuine Taˁizzī dialect. Basically, it
              belongs to the “Western Highlands” dialect group whose hallmark is
              the so-called k-perfect – i.e. the conjugation of the perfect of
              the 1st singular and 2nd singular and plural with suffixes
              containing /k/ where Standard Arabic and other varieties have /t/
              (e.g. <hi rend="italic">katab-ku</hi> ‘I wrote’). This, however,
              is now mostly avoided by urban speakers in favour of the forms
              with a t and cannot be considered typical for Taˁizzī Arabic
              nowadays.</p>
          </div>
          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>The dialect of Taizz has not yet been studied thoroughly. In

              some morphological features of Taˁizzī Arabic can be found, based
              on recordings from speakers living in Beirut (pp.102-109).
              Theodore Prochazka (1974) briefly discusses the use and the
              distribution of the k-perfect in the Arabic of Taizz. </p>
            <p>Peter Behnstedt’s <hi rend="italic">Dialect Atlas of North Yemen
                and Adjacent Areas</hi> (2017) allows for comparison of several

            <p>Tiberias is a small town in lower Galilee at the shores of the
              Sea of Galilee, which in Arabic is named after the city Buḥayrat
              Ṭabariyya. It is both a touristic and economic centre of the
              region. Furthermore, the city plays an important role in Judaism
              and for a long time the large Jewish population lived side by side
              with the Muslim Arabs of that place. In 1948 the Arab population
              of Tiberias was driven out of the city, but there is a – albeit
              rapidly decreasing – number of Jews with Arabic as their mother
              tongue. The dialect therefore can be regarded as a highly
              endangered variety, because it will probably fade with the death
              of the current generation of its speakers.</p>

          <div type="researchHistory">
            <p>A very detailed and substantial study on the Judeo-Arabic dialect
              of Tiberias was done by <ref target="bibl:geva-kleinberger_2009_3208">Geva-Kleinberger
                (2009)</ref>, who examined the features of this dialect and
              especially its autochthonous phrases on the basis of numerous
              recorded and transcribed texts, mainly by elderly people who have
              kept their dialect over the decades. A preliminary study of this
              work with only one sample text is <ref target="bibl:geva_kleinberger_2004_0000">Geva-Kleinberger
                2004</ref>. Even though already at the beginning of the 20th
              century the dialect area of Palestine has been examined, there is
              no dictionary or grammatical study on Tiberias. Nevertheless one
              can find some data in Bergsträsser’s <hi rend="italic">Sprachatlas</hi>
              <hi rend="italic"> von </hi>
              <hi rend="italic">Syrien</hi>
              <hi rend="italic"> und </hi>
              <hi rend="italic">Palästina</hi> 1915 (location no. 36). He did
              not include transcribed texts of that, but from numerous maps, one
              can extract different dialectal features that were used by the
              (Muslim) speakers of Tiberias.</p>
