# VICAV Workflows

This document describes the worklows involved in editing VICAV data.

## Editing

The TEI documents in this repository can be edited with any text editor at hand. For ease of use an Oxygen Project (`vicav.xpr`) is included.

## Converting contributions to TEI

See the README document in the `contributions` directory.

## Technical Tools
### XSLT Scripts

The XSLT scripts in `tools/082_scripts_xsl` are used for data conversions in the editorial process.

## TEI ODDs

For each of the above meantioned text type (corpus, linguistic features, etc) there will be a dedicated ODD document which defines a TEI model tailored to the text types's specific structure.
