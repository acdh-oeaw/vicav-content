# Converting external contributions to TEI-XML

1. Add the docx document to this directory (called `contributions`).
2. In Oxygen (with the VICAV project open): Right click on the Word document and select `Transform > Transform with`.
2. A dialog box opens where you can select which transformation scenario to run:    

   * For a linguistic feature list choose *DOCX to TEI: Feature List*.
   * For a profile document choose *DOCX to TEI: Profile*.
   * For a sample text choose *DOCX to TEI: Sample Text*.

In case these transformation scenarios do not show up, click on the gear wheel symbol on the upper right side of the dialog box ("Settings") and choose "Show all scenarios".

The resulting TEI file is stored next to the original Word document where you can review and edit it.

After having finished editing, copy it to the respective subdirectory, add it to the git repository and push it to the server.
