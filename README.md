The TEI documents in this repository can be edited with any text editor at hand. For ease of use an Oxygen Project (`vicav.xpr`) is included.

### Converting contributions to TEI 

See the Stephan hat ge√§ndert README document in the `contributions` directory.

## Technical Tools
### XSLT Scripts

The XSLT scripts in `tools/082_scripts_xsl` are used for data conversions in the editorial process.

### TEI ODDs

For each of the above meantioned text type (corpus, linguistic features, etc) there will be a dedicated ODD document which defines a TEI model tailored to the text types's specific structure.
