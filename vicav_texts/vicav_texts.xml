    which lots of efforts have been spent since we have started to compile
    digital dicitionaries. The VICAV project has been dedicated to the use
    of the guidelines of the Text Encoding Inititative in all of its
    dictionaries. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">The team have documented their work in a document which exemplifies
    the most important structures contained in these dictionaries. The

      <div xml:id="vicavVLE">
        <head>Viennese Lexicographic Editor (VLR)</head>

        <p xml:space="preserve">VLE is a fairly new piece of software that first came into existence
    as a by-product of an entirely different development activity: the
    creation of an interactive online learning system for university
    students. Thus, it was first used in a collaborative glossary editing
    project carried out as part of university language courses at the
    University of Vienna. As the tool proved to be flexible and adaptable
    enough, it was also put to work in other projects. The interface is
    built around an XML editor. The communication between the dictionary
    client and the server has been implemented as a RESTful web
    service.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">The interface is built around an XML editor that allows to process
    standard-based lexicographic and terminological data, basically any
    XML-based format such as LMF, TBX, RDF, or TEI can be handled. The
    program provides a number of useful functions to automate editing
    procedures. It can check the structural integrity (well-formedness) of
    input on the fly. Technologically, it draws not only on the XML core
    specification but also on several cognate technologies. XSLT and XPath
    play an important role both for visualizing and modifying existing
    datasets. Lexicographers can insert elements on the basis of
    predefined XML Schemas. Most of the functions can be applied both to
    single and multiple lemmas. One of the most recent improvements is a
    versioning system and an improved working mode that allows
    lexicographers to work on the XML data without actually seeing the
    tags. Furthermore, the editor also has a configurable interface
    enabling lexicographers to access external corpora and to integrate
    example sentences from them into dictionary entries. The communication
    between the dictionary client and the server has been implemented as a
    RESTful web service.</p>

        <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flashcards</ref>. 
        The ubiquitous smartphones make it possible to carry around 
        thousands of vocabulary cards in your pocket. Before we started 
        to cary around a computer in our pockets, the 
        most common way to carry them around as paper flashcards. The problem 
        with this approach is that they can take up quite some space if 
        you want to repeat cards from say 20 units of some language course 
        at least now and then. Now we only have to decide on what software to use. </p>
      </div>

      <div xml:id="vicavLearningPrograms">
        <head>Available Programs</head>

        <p xml:space="preserve">There are several programs that help you repeat vocabularies on the

      <div xml:id="vicavExplBar_DesignPrinciples">
        <head>Design Principles</head>

        <p xml:space="preserve">Displaying complexly structured scholarly contents on screens has 
    always been a design challenge. What has made the situation even more 
    complicated is that these days web applications are supposed to run on 
    any kind of device. VICAV is basically built on responsive technology. 
    However, the website has not been optimised for use on smaller mobile 
    devices yet.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">Research environments have to work on the Internet these days, which 
     means they need to be implemented as web interfaces that run in browsers. 
     By doing this, one forgoes the powerful possibilities of the windows 
     based systems, on the other side you attaina higher degree of systemic 
     interoperability, reusability and will definitely be able to address a much 
     larger audience.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">One drawback of the browser approach has been, that it is usually not 
     possible to have several tabs next to each other which hampers any 
     processes aiming at comparing texts. Whenever you want to juxtapose 
     data one has to find other approaches. One possibility to create a 
     flexible solution to the issue of structuring data on a single surface  
     has been "panelification", visualising data in smaller units that  
     actually emulate forms or windows. We have been experimenting with 
     several approaches. In previous versions of VICAV, the panels were 
     freely movable on the screen which gave users a lot of flexibility 
     to arrange the materials they were interested in on the screen. 
     However, experience has shown that the screen tends to
     get cluttered easily.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">The current approach strikes a balance between a structure where 
     the user has full control over the psoition and size of panels and 
     a static approach where particualr types of text have a fixed position 
     on the screen. Most data on the VICAV website is now displayed in 
     collapsible panels which have a fixed size and fixed positions. 
     Users can open and close these panels, has some control over their 
     size and has full control over the order in whcih he accesses 
     particular contens. Like this, it is still possible to juxtapose 
     particular items and compare them by open them in the right order.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">
      <graphic url="vicav_panels__001.jpg"/>
  </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">'Overcrowding' of the screen is avoided by a simple mechanisms that  
   collapses panels when there are more than three panels open. The collapsed 
   panels still remain on the screen and can be reopened at any time.
   Panels which trigger queries stay open as long as they serve this 
   purpose.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve">
      <graphic url="vicav_panels__002.jpg"/>
  </p>


        <p xml:space="preserve">You can open and close any of these panels making use of the controls on the 
    purple bar on the left side. The X in the circle closes the panel completely. 
    The arrow-dash sign allows to open and close it.</p>
