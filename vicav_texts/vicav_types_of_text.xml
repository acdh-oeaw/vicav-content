            <head>Types of Text/Data</head>

            <p xml:space="preserve">Apart from its linguistic goals, the project has been pursuing strong
    interests in various aspects of text technology. The output of the
    work of the contributors is published in form of different types of
    digital language ressources. Our research interests in this
    respect have been related to issues of digital lexicography, visualisation
    of digital language resources in a multilingual environment and the
    application of standards and de-facto standards such as TEI, LMF
    and/or MAF in the creation of digital language resources.</p>

               <head>Language Profiles</head>

               <p xml:space="preserve">At the heart of the website, there are what we have called language
        profiles. This type of text consist in short sketches of varieties 
        of spoken contemporary Arabic. The intention has been to work 
        a complementary manner to similar endeavours (such as EALL). For the
        time being, we do not plan to give detailed grammatical descriptions
        but rather focus on general information, research histories and
        available literature.</p>

               <head>Dictionaries</head>

               <p xml:space="preserve">We have been working on several digital dictionaries which have 
        been created as part of different projects. We call them dictionaries 
        (and not glosaries) as they are made up of self-contained entries which are
        not only used as glosses. All of these have been created to be used
        as part of language teaching activities.</p>

               <p xml:space="preserve">The bibliography is an ongoing effort. Given the limitted
        resources at our disposal, it can not be exhaustive. Here again, 
        one of our intentions is to provide the community with readily reusable
        standardised material.</p>

               <p xml:space="preserve">An important part of our work is standards and de-facto standards.
        The most important part of this toolbox are the
