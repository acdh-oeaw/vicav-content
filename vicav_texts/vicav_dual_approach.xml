        <p>The VICAV website is designed in a manner supposed to allow users to investigate 
                    the available resources through various methods. The basic access mode is to 
                    launch a query by clicking on the symbols on the map.</p>
        <p>There are two distinct symbols: arrows and circles. The arrows indicate particular 
                    locations (towns, parts of towns, villages), the circles are used for regions 
                    that can but do not necessarily correlate with countries.</p>
        <p>

        <p>However, most queries can also be triggered by clicking on menu items or by formulating explicit queries.</p>
