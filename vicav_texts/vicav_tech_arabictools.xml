            <p>The intention of this section of VICAV is to bring together the most
               important tools needed by digitally working linguists in the field of
               Arabic studies. In compiling this list, we have proceded from a very
               wide understanding of the term "tool" considering a varied range of
               digital applications that are typically used in doing linguistic
               research. This comprises all relevant digital language resources as
               well as pertaining documentation, standards and best practices.</p>
            <p>While there have not been around many NLP tools to process Arabic
               language data in the past, the situation has definitely changed in
               recent years. The following list is a first attempt to create a list
               of tools used by the VICAV crew and other relevant projects.</p>
            <p>A very interesting overview of digital Arabic language ressources is
               Wajdi Zaghouani's <ref target="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.07835.pdf">
                  Critical Survey of the Freely Available Arabic Corpora</ref>. </p>
            <p>We have put together some reference material which is not meant to be
               exhaustive. The focus is on freely available resources. We do not list
               details from the many resources available through the
               <ref target="https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/">Linguistic Data Consortium
                  (LDC)</ref> and the <ref target="http://www.elra.info/en/">European
                  Language Resource Association (ELRA)</ref>. The material has been organised
               in the following groups: <list>
