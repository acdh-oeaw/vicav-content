        <head>Vocabularies on the Smartphone</head>
        <p>One way to learn vocabularies is to use
           <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flashcards</ref>.
           The ubiquitous smartphones make it possible to carry around
           thousands of vocabulary cards in your pocket. Before we started
           to cary around a computer in our pockets, the
           most common way to carry them around as paper flashcards. The problem
           with this approach is that they can take up quite some space if
           you want to repeat cards from say 20 units of some language course
           at least now and then. Now we only have to decide on what software to use. </p>
