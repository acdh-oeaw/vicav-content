        <p>VICAV has been designed from the very beginning as a project bridging
           the gap between traditional concepts in the humanities and innovative
           technological approaches. We have been building our work on the paradigms
           of the digital humanity community: digital tools and data, collaborative
           settings and open science are the basis of our work.</p>
        <p>By text technology we understand a broad spectrum of methods and tools
           being applied to a wide range of applications beyond the narrower field
           of computational linguistics with its focus on large corpora and mainly
           statistical approaches. </p>
