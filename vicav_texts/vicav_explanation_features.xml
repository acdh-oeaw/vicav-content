              <p xml:space="preserve">The linguistic features consist in lists of sentence pairs in English
      and Arabic that are meant to exemplify selected salient linguistic
      features of the particular varieties. The list is regarded as work in
      progress and serves as a basis for discussion. The system is designed
      in an extensible manner, open for any amendments, refinements and
      enhancements. Let us know what you think about it, what you would
      add.</p>
              
              <p xml:space="preserve">Nomenclature should reflect the common practice in the community and
      follow linguistically acknowledged standards. It is planned to enter
      the chosen denominations as a draft in the ISOCat list.</p>
              
              <p xml:space="preserve">The list contains a number of repeated examples. We have tried to
      avoid phenomena that are too elusive or difficult to ascertain such as
      e.g. secondary emphasis. The focus has been put on morphology and
      lexis.</p>
              
              <p xml:space="preserve">The lists have also been put together with a didactic purpose in
      mind. They should allow students of Arabic dialectology to quickly get
      a first impression of particular dialects.</p>
              
              <p xml:space="preserve">As of May 2018 we provided linguistic feature lists for these 
      locations (in alphabetic order): <list>
