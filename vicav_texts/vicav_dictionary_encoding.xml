              <p xml:space="preserve">Dictionaries are highly complex knowledge stores on the modelling of
    which lots of efforts have been spent since we have started to compile
    digital dicitionaries. The VICAV project has been dedicated to the use
    of the guidelines of the Text Encoding Inititative in all of its
    dictionaries. </p>
              
              <p xml:space="preserve">The team have documented their work in a document which exemplifies
    the most important structures contained in these dictionaries. The
    <ref target="docs/vicav_dict_encoding__v003.html"> 
    VICAV Dictionary Encoding Guidelines</ref> are meant to allow
    researchers in similar projects to draw on the experiences of our
    work.</p>
