        Arabic articles collected from the Omani newspaper Alwatan. It was prepared 
        by Mahmoud El-Haj (Lancaster University). Articles in the collection 
        fall into six categories: culture, economy, local-news, international-news, 
        religion, and sports. KALIMAT is freely available via

        Corpus of Arabic (ICA)</ref> is an ambitious attempt to
        build a representative corpus of the Arabic language as it is used
        all over the Arab world, with the aim of supporting research on such
        language. The ICA is planned to contain 100 million words. Once
        finished, the analyzed version will be the first analyzed Arabic
        corpus available as a linguistic resource for researchers. It is
        also the first systematic investigation of national varieties within
        the Arabic speaking community, this should prove very useful for
        linguists who believe that their theories and descriptions of
        language should be based on real, rather than contrived, data."</p>

        <ref target="http://arabicorpus.byu.edu/">This corpus</ref> is a
        sizeable corpus (173,600,000 words) containing texts in five main
        categories or genres: Newspapers, Modern Literature, Nonfiction,
        Egyptian Colloquial, and Premodern. It has been maintained by Dil
        Parkinson, professor of Arabic and allows users to find larger
        structures and grammatical patterns through frequency analysis,
        regular expression searching, and other interface features.</p>

         contents of which are classified based on time, region, medium, domain and 
         topic. It comprises more than 700 million words from the pre-Islamic era 
         to the present day (a period covering more than 1,500 years). However, most 
         of the data belongs into the recent past which is why it is listed under MSA. 
         It can be explored on the <ref target="http://corpus.kacst.edu.sa/">Internet</ref> using a variety of tools.</p>
