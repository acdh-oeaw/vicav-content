        "abstractNote": "Collocation is the habitual co-occurrence of words and a manifestation of the idiomatic usage of the language. Constituent elements of a collocation combine with each other in varying degrees of rigidity and flexibility the level of which depends on the relationship between them. Lexical collocations are the frequent combination of content words in comparison to the association with grammatical words. The way in which words in Arabic accompany each other ranges from idioms and fixed expressions, to free collocations. This paper investigates Arabic lexical collocations and provides an account of its patterns. It proposes a typology of lexical collocations in Arabic, and discusses their types, structures and restrictions. Issues such as semantic and syntactic features of collocations as well as culture and register are discussed. Grammatical collocation is addressed only in relation to the main discussion of lexical collocation. Corpora of Arabic were used to detect and verify occurrences of collocations.",
