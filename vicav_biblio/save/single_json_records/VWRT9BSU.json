        "abstractNote": "This study thoroughly describes the phonological and morphological processes of Moroccan Arabic within the general framework of generative theory. The goal has been to provide a comprehensive, formal analysis of the Moroccan data, while providing an abundance of sample alternations, derivations, and paradigms for use by subsequent researchers. Since the thesis is broad in scope, it has been necessary to examine a wide spectrum of theoretical issues. First, this study proposes an expansion of metrical theory in which the metrical structure of words is viewed as a constraint on the output of phonological rules. Secondly, the study challenges the standard generative view of morphology–that the word constitutes the base for regular morphological processes. Instead, evidence is provided that in Moroccan Arabic it is the morpheme (or root) which actually constitutes the base for all morphological processes.",
