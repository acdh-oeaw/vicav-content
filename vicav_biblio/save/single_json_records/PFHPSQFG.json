        "abstractNote": "This paper examines the main characteristics of high frequency phatic utterances in Arabic, and seeks to establish a deeper understanding of these expressions by studying them against the interrelationships between language, culture and society. The study bases its analysis on data from a questionnaire involving 80 university students of both sexes, and uses ample evidence from Modern Standard Arabic as well as dialectal Arabic. Findings of this study bring into focus a number of important facts about phatic communication in Arabic, particularly that it constitutes a textbook example of communication that is loaded with religion. The study also hints to some major aspects of difference between Arabic and English phatic utterances.",
