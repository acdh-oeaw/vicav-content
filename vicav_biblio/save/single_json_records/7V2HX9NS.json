        "abstractNote": "This paper focuses on defining lexical doublets in written Arabic literary discourse and describing their role in developing what may be called complex meaning (Neubert & Shreve 1992:109). Lexical doublets are sets of two (near-) synonyms connected with the particles &#x648; 'and', &#x648;&#x623; 'or', or zero. The study of doublets has to do with semantic repetition in language in terms of forms and functions within a specific textual context and an overall web of cohesive relations, i. e. at the macrolevel. Lexical doublets are examined from the perspective of meaning, i.e. denotative, connotative and textual. This involves two processes: categorization and interpretation. The former implies the examination of doublets in terms of well established categories, whilst the latter concerns the semantic interaction that holds between the constitutive elements and how their semantic output is influenced by the network of collocations in their milieu. Two kinds of interaction are identified: internal, between the doublet's elements and external, between the doublet and the co-text. Internal interaction involves three degrees of overlapping: maximal, medial and minimal. It is argued that what is at issue is a stereoscopic pattern that extends beyond the limits of a doublet. In translation, one of the translation procedures is to render the doublet in its entirety with the intent of relaying the whole meaning. Doublets can fine-tune textual cohesion in the target text (TT) along the overall global meaning of the source text (ST).",
