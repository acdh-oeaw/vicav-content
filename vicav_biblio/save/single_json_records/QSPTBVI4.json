        "abstractNote": "Drawing on perceptual dialectology and ethnographic research, this paper explores Moroccan Arabic speakers' ideologized perceptions of different regional and national Arabic vernaculars. Specifically, data come from a map-drawing and labeling task by 52 Moroccans of different ages and social classes divided equally between men and women. The study's aims are twofold: (1) to explore Moroccans' most commonly drawn perceptual linguistic boundaries of the Arabic-speaking world; and (2) to develop a better understanding of the underlying ideologies that render a particular national or regional Arabic a &#x201c;good&#x201d; or &#x201c;bad&#x201d; variety of Arabic, especially from the perspective of speakers of a non-dominant variety. Preliminary findings show participants' subjective dialect divisions are to a large extent consistent with the five Arabic dialect areas defined by dialectologists. Further evaluative map-labeling, however, reveals systematic inter- and intra-regional sociolinguistic hierarchization, with the majority of Moroccan participants positioning Syrian Arabic as the &#x201c;best Arabic,&#x201d; based on a complex range of ideologies, beliefs, and attitudes. The research also shows participants' ambivalences towards other varieties of Arabic, including their own national variety. As the first study to extend the &#x2018;draw-a-map&#x2019; method to Arabic dialects, this research contributes to Arabic dialectology and sociolinguistics, and adds to the emerging field of perceptual dialectology (PRESTON 1999, LONG &#x2014; PRESTON 2002).",
