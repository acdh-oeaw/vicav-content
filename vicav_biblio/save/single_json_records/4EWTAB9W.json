        "abstractNote": "This thesis is designed to study various Moroccan Arabic (MA) wh- constructions both within the Government and Binding (GB) framework and the Minimalist Program (MP). It is, specifically, confined to relative clause formation, left dislocation (topicalization) and questions. A detailed analysis of relative clause formation is provided. It is particularly argued that the resumptive pronoun insertion in relatives is a last resort strategy which is used only where movement fails. It is also shown that resumptive pronouns function as variables which are bound by null operators in LF. In the course of this analysis, the issues of the Binding Theory and of the A$\\sp\\prime$-disjointness requirement with respect to resumptive pronouns are also discussed. Subsequently, an examination of yes-no questions is given. Additionally, Cheng's (1991) generalization that the availability of question particles correlates with the lack of syntactic wh-movement is investigated in detail. Finally, the recent minimalist version (Chomsky 1995) is applied to the issue of optionality in word orders and to certain wh-constructions. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",
