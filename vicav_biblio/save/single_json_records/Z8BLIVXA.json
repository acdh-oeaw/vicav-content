        "abstractNote": "This article provides a survey and analysis of cases of asyndetic clause combining in Gulf Arabic dialects. Arabic dialects contain a variety of chains of asyndetically joined verbs. Whether all or some of these should be regarded as instances of verb serialization is disputable (WOIDICH 2002; VERSTEEGH 2009). One reason for this terminological uncertainty is that the field still awaits a unified definition of &#x2018;serial verbs&#x2019; and &#x2018;verb serialization&#x2019;. The analysis of data presented in this article provides a valuable addition to the discussion and the pursuit of a more discrete use of the term &#x2018;verb serialization&#x2019; in Arabic dialectology. Irrespective of labels and terminology, it is obvious that the propensity for juxtaposing finite verbs with no marker of coordination or subordination, in Arabic dialects, has promoted the development of an array of modal and aspectual modifiers through gradual grammaticalization of the first verb of two or more in a series. This article presents a thorough survey of such modal and aspectual modifiers in Gulf Arabic based on a large database of authentic speech. In addition to modal and aspectual modifiers, asyndetically juxtaposed verbs function as circumstantial and/or adverbial modifiers. In one of their functions, they serve in the Arabic lexicon as a verb phrase variety of the well-known use of parallelism that is found with nouns: the so called lexical couplets. The degree of grammaticalization of these modifiers in the present Gulf Arabic corpus appears to be less than we would find in descriptions of, for example, Egyptian and Levantine dialects.",
