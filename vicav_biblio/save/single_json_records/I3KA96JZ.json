        "abstractNote": "That many Arabic dialects negate with an enclitic &#x2013;&#x161; has attracted much comment, very often drawing analogies between the French and Arabic systems. Constructs negated with a post-positioned negative &#x2013;&#x161; alone without the characteristically Arabic preposed negator m&#x101; are said to bear similarities to stage III of the Jespersen's cycle as it operates in Indo-European languages. Nevertheless, comparisons between the copular interrogatives an&#x12b;&#x161; or an&#x101;&#x161; and huw&#x101;&#x161; in medieval Andalusi Arabic, their 19th century Maltese counterparts jeniex and hujex, their survivals in modern Maltese huwa and hux, and their relics in the modern spoken Moroccan Arabic interrogative wa&#x161;, and its equivalents huwwa/hiyya/humma in spoken Egyptian Arabic call such assumptions into question. From those, it appears that the enclitic &#x2013;&#x161; began as an interrogative, having lost much &#x2013; but not all &#x2013; of its interrogative quality as it was reanalysed as a negator. As such, Arabic negation never went through a Jespersen's cycle.",
