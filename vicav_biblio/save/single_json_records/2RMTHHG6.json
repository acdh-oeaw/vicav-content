        "abstractNote": "The existence of Arabic dialects was not unknown to the classical Arab grammarians at least since SIBAWAYHI's Al-Kit&#x101;b in the 8th century CE (SIBAWAYHI &#x2014; DERENBOURG 1970). The study of Arabic dialects has developed immensely especially since the beginning of the 20th century. Our goal in this study is to summarize topics that deserve further study. For this goal we scan much of the existing literature of Arabic dialectology in the 20th century, and describe their main areas. We first compare GvG (BROCKELMANN 1908, 1913) with the recent EALL (VERSTEEGH 2006&#x2013;2009). Even the difference between these works reflects development trends of Arabic dialectology. Next, we focus on research methods developed during this century, often following general linguistics trends. Among the new fields we note dialect geography, sociolinguistic dialect studies, Arabic diglossia issues, acoustic phonetics, and applied (computerized) dialect studies. As the development of Arabic dialects in the 20th century is considered mainly due to demographic shifts in the Middle East and North Africa, we suggest special attention be paid to sociolinguistics.",
