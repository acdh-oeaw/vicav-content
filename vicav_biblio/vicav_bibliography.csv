Despite the claims that this is a historical process which no longer applies and that long mid vowels are underlying in CA, the absence of short mid vowels in this dialect raises certain theoretical concerns. This paper examines the distribution of mid vowels and diphthongs in CA and provides evidence that all mid vowels are synchronically derived from underlying diphthongs. Diphthongs, however, surface in systematic environments: after the shortening of underlying long low vowels, across morpheme boundaries, when a geminate glide is involved, and in a few lexical exceptions &#x2013; contexts which resist phonological processes across languages. I argue that the appearance of CA long mid vowels is the result of total assimilation of two adjacent vocalic root nodes. As a consequence, CA and CLA surface forms can both be derived from diphthongal underlying representations with minimal constraint re-ranking.","2010","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","5-38","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:youssef_2010_2812)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Constructs negated with a post-positioned negative &#x2013;&#x161; alone without the characteristically Arabic preposed negator m&#x101; are said to bear similarities to stage III of the Jespersen's cycle as it operates in Indo-European languages. Nevertheless, comparisons between the copular interrogatives an&#x12b;&#x161; or an&#x101;&#x161; and huw&#x101;&#x161; in medieval Andalusi Arabic, their 19th century Maltese counterparts jeniex and hujex, their survivals in modern Maltese huwa and hux, and their relics in the modern spoken Moroccan Arabic interrogative wa&#x161;, and its equivalents huwwa/hiyya/humma in spoken Egyptian Arabic call such assumptions into question. From those, it appears that the enclitic &#x2013;&#x161; began as an interrogative, having lost much &#x2013; but not all &#x2013; of its interrogative quality as it was reanalysed as a negator.

Analogies with the problems of modern anthropological fieldwork are investigated, and the impact of the preconceptions and assumptions that the scholars brought to the field is highlighted. It is shown that mediaeval Muslim scholars’ fieldwork might involve varying activities taking place in different settings, and the term ‘Bedouin informants’ masks quite a variety of individuals claiming some expertise in ‘Bedouin’ culture. The idealised image of a scholar heading for the Arabian deserts to visit genuine nomads and make lengthy inquiries among them might be less typical than is often implicitly thought to have been. On the basis of concrete cases of data-collection, three fundamental assumptions heavily influencing the scholars’ thinking regarding Bedouin culture are identified.","2015","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","124-147","","1","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:szombathy_2015_2965)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UZQXYSAL","journalArticle","2009","Souag, Lameen","Siwa and its significance for Arabic dialectology","Zeitschrift für Arabische Linguistik","","","","","Siwi, spoken at the oasis of Siwa in western Egypt, is best known for being the easternmost Berber language, but its very substantial Arabic element includes not only much of its lexicon and syntax but also several aspects of its morphology. The q reflex of qāf and the final 'imāla of historic ā to ī shown in loanwords alone suffice to establish that the greater part of this influence derives neither from the Sulaymi Bedouin dialect spoken throughout western Egypt and eastern Libya nor from the modern Cairene dialect whose influence is spread throughout Egypt through media; instead, these two features link Siwa to other Egyptian oases. Some probable or certain Arabic elements borrowed into Siwi grammar, notably the suggestative particle dā < da`, the negation system including lā and qəṭṭ, the phenomenon of demonstrative agreement with the addressee, and the actor noun formation a-CəCCēCī, underline Siwi's archaism relative not only to the currently dominant Arabic dialects of the region but in some cases to most or all modern Arabic dialects. The depth of Arabic influence on Siwi, including several borrowed templatic morphemes at least one of which is inflectional, suggests very close social contact, and historical sources indicate a settled Arab presence in the oasis alongside Berber in the twelfth century. The Arabic element of Siwi thus appears to be a key resource for Arabic dialectology, providing a new source of evidence on sedentary Arabic dialects that reached western Egypt and Cyrenaica independently of the Banī Sulaym and probably prior to their 11th century arrival.

As reported by Gibbons, 30S dynein could recombine with the outer fibers, while 14S dynein did to so a lesser extent. At acidic pH, however, most of the 14S dynein was also rebound to the outer fibers. When an excess of crude dynein fraction was added to the outer fiber fraction at pH 8.2, electron microscopic observations showed that the outer doublet microtubules were decorated not only with arms but also with other electron-dense materials. On the other hand, when crude dynein fraction was mixed with the outer fibers in an appropriate quantity, only arms were reconstituted at the regular positions of A-subfibers. ATP had an inhibitory effect on the recombination of dynein with the outer fibers.","1975-07","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","41-49","","1","78","","J.

"LEHAGK3A","journalArticle","2008","Sadiqi, Fatima","Language and gender in Moroccan urban areas","International Journal of the Sociology of Language","","","","","A central issue in the interaction between language and gender in Morocco is urbanity. The written languages, namely Modern Standard Arabic and French, are the languages of institutions which have always been closely linked to urban areas, the typical loci of knowledge and power. Non-written languages, namely Berber and Moroccan colloquial Arabic, are represented as rural and indigenous because they are unlearned and are associated with rural areas, particularly Berber. Unlike the latter, Modern Standard Arabic and French are powerful because they are elitist, given their relation to education, government, and religion (Modern Standard Arabic). Berber and Moroccan Arabic are considered low or powerless because they lack the above-mentioned qualities and they are unimportant for social promotion. Language representations in Morocco are also important because they interact in significant ways with gender. Whereas Modern Standard Arabic and French are associated with public space, Berber and Moroccan Arabic are linked to private space, which happens to be the typical space of women; given the correlation between women, native tongues, and private space. However, with women's access to free education and to work in postcolonial Morocco, the notion of space changed, resulting in the recent mass feminization of the public sphere and women's access to â€œurbanâ€� languages, i.e., French and Modern Standard Arabic. As women have become more active in public life and the public sphere in general, they are considerably contributing to linguistic change and diversity and intensely instigating significant social changes.","2008","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","145–165","","190","2008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:sadiqi_2008_4207)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:urban dialect; vt:Maghreb; vt:description of dialect; vt:sociolinguistics; vt:linguistics/dialectology; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:gender aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sadiqi labels the various languages used in Morocco, Standard and dialectal Arabic, French, and Amazigh (Berber) in terms of gender. Her observations are compared to the De Ruiter data on language proficiency, use, and attitudes of young Moroccan men and women with the aim to see to what extent the gender characterization of Sadiqi and the data of De Ruiter match.

The study of Arabic dialects has developed immensely especially since the beginning of the 20th century. Our goal in this study is to summarize topics that deserve further study. For this goal we scan much of the existing literature of Arabic dialectology in the 20th century, and describe their main areas. We first compare GvG (BROCKELMANN 1908, 1913) with the recent EALL (VERSTEEGH 2006&#x2013;2009). Even the difference between these works reflects development trends of Arabic dialectology. Next, we focus on research methods developed during this century, often following general linguistics trends. Among the new fields we note dialect geography, sociolinguistic dialect studies, Arabic diglossia issues, acoustic phonetics, and applied (computerized) dialect studies. As the development of Arabic dialects in the 20th century is considered mainly due to demographic shifts in the Middle East and North Africa, we suggest special attention be paid to sociolinguistics.","2011","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","42-66","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:rosenhouse_2011_2808)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arabic dialects contain a variety of chains of asyndetically joined verbs. Whether all or some of these should be regarded as instances of verb serialization is disputable (WOIDICH 2002; VERSTEEGH 2009). One reason for this terminological uncertainty is that the field still awaits a unified definition of &#x2018;serial verbs&#x2019; and &#x2018;verb serialization&#x2019;. The analysis of data presented in this article provides a valuable addition to the discussion and the pursuit of a more discrete use of the term &#x2018;verb serialization&#x2019; in Arabic dialectology. Irrespective of labels and terminology, it is obvious that the propensity for juxtaposing finite verbs with no marker of coordination or subordination, in Arabic dialects, has promoted the development of an array of modal and aspectual modifiers through gradual grammaticalization of the first verb of two or more in a series. This article presents a thorough survey of such modal and aspectual modifiers in Gulf Arabic based on a large database of authentic speech. In addition to modal and aspectual modifiers, asyndetically juxtaposed verbs function as circumstantial and/or adverbial modifiers. In one of their functions, they serve in the Arabic lexicon as a verb phrase variety of the well-known use of parallelism that is found with nouns: the so called lexical couplets. The degree of grammaticalization of these modifiers in the present Gulf Arabic corpus appears to be less than we would find in descriptions of, for example, Egyptian and Levantine dialects.","2013","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","5-39","","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:persson_2013_2802)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My particular informant, who also accompanied me during the tour, was Mr. Idris ‘Abdallah, from Gyrene, a member of the Ḥāsa tribe. The dialect illustrated may be termed the Bedouin dialect of the Jebel. Examples are given throughout in Arabic script and follow the method used by my informant for writing his dialect. Thus presented, they are immediately intelligible to a literate Cyrenaican, who is accustomed to written colloquialisms, for example in letters, petitions, agreements, and vernacular (usually Bedouin) poems appearing in the local Press. The phonetic transcription is intended to suggest a pronunciation for the examples.","1952","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","11-33","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:mitchell_1952_4586)","","","","vt:Maghreb; vt:morphology; vt:syntax; reg:Libya [28.79, 18.04]; geo:Cyrenaica [35.06, 24.95]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reading takes it instead as an assertion of cultic legitimacy, in which the dedication of a statue (Aramaic &#x1e63;lm) to Obodas the God is defended as ""no departure"" (Arabic l&#x101; forran) from legitimate Nabataean worship.

The q reflex of q&#x101;f and the final &#x2be;im&#x101;la of historic &#x101; to &#x12b; shown in loanwords alone suffice to establish that the greater part of this influence derives neither from the Sulaymi Bedouin dialect spoken throughout western Egypt and eastern Libya nor from the modern Cairene dialect whose influence is spread throughout Egypt through media; instead, these two features link Siwa to other Egyptian oases. Some Arabic elements borrowed into Siwi grammar, notably the negation system including l&#x101; and q&#x4d9;t&#x324;t, the actor noun formation a-C&#x4d9;CC&#x113;C&#x12b;, and possibly the phenomenon of demonstrative agreement with the addressee, underline Siwi's archaism relative not only to the currently dominant Arabic dialects of the region but in some cases to most or all modern Arabic dialects. The depth of Arabic influence on Siwi, including several borrowed templatic morphemes at least one of which is inflectional, suggests very close social contact, and historical sources indicate a settled Arab presence in the oasis alongside Berber in the twelfth century. The Arabic element of Siwi thus appears to be a key resource for Arabic dialectology, providing a new source of evidence on sedentary Arabic dialects that reached western Egypt and Cyrenaica independently of the Ban&#x12b; Sulaym and probably prior to their 11th century arrival.","2009","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","51-75","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:lameen souag_2009_2818)","","","","vt:Egypt-Sudan; vt:general/comparative study; vt:linguistics/dialectology; reg:Egypt [27.39, 30.26]; geo:Siwa [29.20, 25.51]; vt:diachronic perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7V2HX9NS","journalArticle","2007","Jawad, Hisham A.","Lexical doublets in Arabic Literary Discourse: Stereoscopy and Complex Meaning","Zeitschrift für Arabische Linguistik","","0170026X","","http://www.jstor.org.uaccess.univie.ac.at/stable/43525816","This paper focuses on defining lexical doublets in written Arabic literary discourse and describing their role in developing what may be called complex meaning (Neubert & Shreve 1992:109). Lexical doublets are sets of two (near-) synonyms connected with the particles &#x648; 'and', &#x648;&#x623; 'or', or zero. The study of doublets has to do with semantic repetition in language in terms of forms and functions within a specific textual context and an overall web of cohesive relations, i. e. at the macrolevel. Lexical doublets are examined from the perspective of meaning, i.e. denotative, connotative and textual. This involves two processes: categorization and interpretation. The former implies the examination of doublets in terms of well established categories, whilst the latter concerns the semantic interaction that holds between the constitutive elements and how their semantic output is influenced by the network of collocations in their milieu. Two kinds of interaction are identified: internal, between the doublet's elements and external, between the doublet and the co-text. Internal interaction involves three degrees of overlapping: maximal, medial and minimal. It is argued that what is at issue is a stereoscopic pattern that extends beyond the limits of a doublet. In translation, one of the translation procedures is to render the doublet in its entirety with the intent of relaying the whole meaning.

Constituent elements of a collocation combine with each other in varying degrees of rigidity and flexibility the level of which depends on the relationship between them. Lexical collocations are the frequent combination of content words in comparison to the association with grammatical words. The way in which words in Arabic accompany each other ranges from idioms and fixed expressions, to free collocations. This paper investigates Arabic lexical collocations and provides an account of its patterns. It proposes a typology of lexical collocations in Arabic, and discusses their types, structures and restrictions. Issues such as semantic and syntactic features of collocations as well as culture and register are discussed. Grammatical collocation is addressed only in relation to the main discussion of lexical collocation. Corpora of Arabic were used to detect and verify occurrences of collocations.","2015","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","71-99","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:izwaini_2015_2816)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:lexicon; vt:Arab World general; vt:phraseology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I focus on typical patterns of diglossic and bilingual codeswitching at several linguistic levels. For example, diglossic switching at phonological and morphological levels is common, subject to order hierarchies and resulting in hybrid forms; but bilingual phonological and morphological switching do not occur independently of lexical switching. Mixed morphology is frequent in both diglossic and bilingual codeswitching. Syntax is not commonly switched in either the diglossic or bilingual dimensions, and is usually of the matrix language, Negev Arabic, as are system morphs (such as the article, prepositions, and pronouns). Switching at lexical and phraseological levels is the most common process in both dimensions, with content words or phrases (nominal, adjectival, prepositional and verbal) and discourse markers most frequently switched. This highly flexible and dynamic style, with the speakers maneuvering skillfully along the diglossic and the bilingual scales, is acquired through exposure to high education and intense language contact.","2015","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","5-34","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:henkin_2015_2788)","","","","vt:sociolinguistics; vt:transcribed texts; vt:bedouin dialect; reg:Israel [31.53, 34.83]; vt:contact linguistics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, data come from a map-drawing and labeling task by 52 Moroccans of different ages and social classes divided equally between men and women. The study's aims are twofold: (1) to explore Moroccans' most commonly drawn perceptual linguistic boundaries of the Arabic-speaking world; and (2) to develop a better understanding of the underlying ideologies that render a particular national or regional Arabic a &#x201c;good&#x201d; or &#x201c;bad&#x201d; variety of Arabic, especially from the perspective of speakers of a non-dominant variety. Preliminary findings show participants' subjective dialect divisions are to a large extent consistent with the five Arabic dialect areas defined by dialectologists. Further evaluative map-labeling, however, reveals systematic inter- and intra-regional sociolinguistic hierarchization, with the majority of Moroccan participants positioning Syrian Arabic as the &#x201c;best Arabic,&#x201d; based on a complex range of ideologies, beliefs, and attitudes. The research also shows participants' ambivalences towards other varieties of Arabic, including their own national variety. As the first study to extend the &#x2018;draw-a-map&#x2019; method to Arabic dialects, this research contributes to Arabic dialectology and sociolinguistics, and adds to the emerging field of perceptual dialectology (PRESTON 1999, LONG &#x2014; PRESTON 2002).","2015","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-10-04 18:30:28","","35-70","","","61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:hachimi_2015_2787)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"IEJ83IJP","journalArticle","2008","Embarki, Mohamed","Emergence et développement de la différenciation de genre entre 7 et 18 ans : perception de stimuli en arabe marocain en milieu scolaire à Ksar el Kébir","International Journal of the Sociology of Language","","","","","Abstract This study is based on the theoretical premise that space shapes language use and that the interaction between language and space is subject to a social stratification built on gender. The Arabic variety of Ksar el Kebir, which is focused on here, presents a linguistic peculiarity, namely the absence of the opposition of vowel quantity. This characteristic, which developed during centuries because of historical, demographic, social specificities, and language contact, is not shared by the other Arabic varieties spoken in Morocco. However, strongly influenced by the prestigious Standard Arabic, the educated informants perceive an opposition of duration between vowels. This study explores, on the one hand, the gender differences in the perception of Moroccan lexemes, and on the other hand, the emergence of this distinction and its development during the primary and secondary school levels. The targeted population here is composed of 96 informants aged between 7 and 18, living in Ksar el Kebir, 48 girls and 48 boys, half of them living in the city center, and the other half in a new district in the suburbs. The informants had either primary or secondary education level, with 8 informants of the same age per level, 4 girls and 4 boys. Two lists of Moroccan Arabic lexemes of identical syllabic structure have been used as support for the test of perception [C1a1â€“C2a2], which after acoustic analysis, did not present any difference in vowel duration. Out of a total of 1920 lexemes and 3840 transcribed vowels, 1422 lexemes were perceived as including one or two long vowels [a:], i.e., 74%. The lexemes which were properly perceived represented 498, i.e., 25.9% of the total. The results reveal that, given the stimuli which contain no quantity opposition, the informants reconstruct mentally this contrast. Girls were more prompt to perceive the contrast of quantity as early as the first grades in primary school. The perception gap of more than 30% between the two sexes is maintained during almost the whole period of schooling","2008","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","121–143","","190","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:embarki_2008_3607)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:sociolinguistics; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; geo:Ksar el-Kebir [35.00, -5.91]; vt:gender aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In studies of the Omani dialect area these terms are used to distinguish between the speech of the traditionally settled populace concentrated around the mountainous interior of the country (S type) on the one hand, and the nomadic and recently settled communities of the deserts (B type) on the other. In some transitional regions located in the area between these two regions the classification of dialects is somewhat blurred, as the varieties of Arabic spoken there exhibit characteristics of both S and B types. The town of al-Dar&#x12b;z, which is located in the interior of northern Oman, lies in one such transitional region. The present contribution examines important structural features of the spoken Arabic of al-Dar&#x12b;z and places the findings within the broader Omani context. It is shown that although the dialect exhibits some characteristics of accommodation to the speech of nearby Bedouin communities with respect to certain phonological features, the dialect of al-Dar&#x12b;z retains most of the distinctly S-type features spoken among the historically settled communities of the mountain region to the north of the country. This is in striking contrast with the situation in the town of al-Mintirib, which is located to the south of al-Dar&#x12b;z, where the speech of the historically sedentary population exhibits most of the B-type features which characterise the speech of the surrounding nomadic population. The differences in the spoken Arabic of al-Dar&#x12b;z and al-Mintirib can be explained by the contrasting socio-historical circumstances in which the dialects of each town has developed.","2011","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","27-41","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:eades_2011_2807)","","","","vt:description of dialect; vt:Oman/Yemen; reg:Arabian Peninsula [22.36, 46.81]; reg:Oman [21.40, 57.76]/Yemen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on one type &#x2014; the relative clauses. Every subordinate clause is introduced by specific conjunctions, while the subordinate clause has its unique syntactic structure; for example, the particles &#x2be;inna and its sisters are followed by the subject in the accusative and not in the nominative case. This paper aims to provide a detailed description of the syntactic structure of the relative clause and its syntactic elements, based on the descriptions of traditional Arab grammarians and Western grammarians. Thus, the paper is divided into five sections in accordance with the issues discussed in the grammatical descriptions: 1 The conjunctive nouns 2 The function of the conjunctive/relative clause 3 The pronoun referring to the qualified noun (al-&#x2bf;&#x101;&#x2be;id) 4 What can function as &#x1e63;ila 5 The position of syntactic elements in the conjunctive/relative clause","2016","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","69-86","","64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:dror_2016_2781)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:syntax; vt:Arab World general; vt:diachronic perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AP is one of several features common to all the dialects of Oman, having been retained in dialects of both the ""Bedouin"" (B) and ""sedentary"" (S) types. In a study of the AP in dialects of Oman and eastern Arabia, Clive Holes (1998) showed that this category survives as a functioning marker of the passive voice in Omani S dialects mostly in the historically isolated interior of the country, albeit in verbs belonging to a restricted set of syntactic and lexicosemantic categories. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether the same process of recession has taken place in a B dialect of the Omani interior. Results of the study reveal that in the B dialect of the Hidy&#x12b;w&#x12b; tribe, whose d&#x12b;ra is located in the hinterland of Mu&#x1e0d;aybi in northern Oman, the AP is significantly more productive than in the S dialects described by Holes. This contrast corresponds with certain socio-historical factors which distinguish the different speech communities of the interior. In particular, the Hidy&#x12b;w&#x12b; community is significantly more isolated from outsider contact and maintains a more homogeneous, tight-knit social structure than towns in which the S dialects are spoken.","2009","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-09-01 11:51:41","","5-21","","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:domenyk eades_2009_2820)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The distribution of these constructions is investigated in semi-spontaneous narratives (frog stories) from four Moroccan cities and from the diaspora community in the Netherlands. This distribution is found to depend very much on the individual lexical items that head the construction, and on the form of the dependent, pronominal dependents favouring the synthetic form. Regional variation in Morocco is linked to the sociolinguistic history of the regions. The northern town of Tangier, where language contact with Berber (and Late Latin) had the greatest impact on the formation of Arabic dialects, shows the greatest preference for the analytic genitive. The immigrant community in the Netherlands shows an increased preference for the analytic form in comparison with their peers in Morocco. This concerns possessives with NP dependents in particular, which suggests a direct influence of Dutch as the socially dominant language.","2006","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","213-231","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:boumans_2006_4213)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:syntax; vt:lexicon; vt:Arabic as a minority language; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:contact linguistics; vt:ethnic minorities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owing to the lack of recent data on Benghazi Arabic, recent linguistic publications have not been able to take into account certain of its features. Benghazi Arabic can be characterized as a Maghrebi dialect of the Bedouin type, and has historical links to other dialects of Libya and North Africa more broadly. It has a number of conservative features &#x2013; such as retention of gender distinction in both the singular and plural verb &#x2013; but also has some unique innovations in morphology and syntax. Influences observable in its lexicon range from sub-Saharan African languages to Turkish and Italian, while there are also interesting syntactic and lexical parallels with the Berber languages of Libya. This article attempts to summarize some features of Benghazi Arabic relevant to Arabic dialectology, discuss particular changes discernable in the dialect over the last century, and contribute to recent scholarship on Libyan Arabic dialects. It is based mainly on the author's own fieldwork in Benghazi during 2010&#x2013;11.","2014","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-18 13:13:51","","57-102","","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:benkato_2014_2793)","","","","geo:Benghazi [32.09, 20.18]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the basis of the distribution of number-sensitive items, they argue that this type of agreement is due to clausal coordination. Munn (1999) argues against ABS's account and proposes that first conjunct agreement in the Arabic dialects arises because coordination of NP subjects is semantically plural but syntactically singular.

The study bases its analysis on data from a questionnaire involving 80 university students of both sexes, and uses ample evidence from Modern Standard Arabic as well as dialectal Arabic. Findings of this study bring into focus a number of important facts about phatic communication in Arabic, particularly that it constitutes a textbook example of communication that is loaded with religion. The study also hints to some major aspects of difference between Arabic and English phatic utterances.","2009","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","22-38","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:ali_2009_2822)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:phonology; vt:sociolinguistics; vt:Arab World general","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These phonemes were voiceless in Old Arabic, as proven by Greek transcriptions from the pre-Islamic period, and so pre-Hilalian Maghrebian Arabic may continue the original situation. The voiced reflexes, more common in other modern Arabic dialects and in the conventional pronunciation of Classical Arabic, are then interpreted as a later development.","2015","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","88-95","","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:al-jallad_2015_2786)","","","","vt:phonology; vt:urban dialect; vt:sociolinguistics; vt:sedentary dialect; vt:linguistics/dialectology; vt:diachronic perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On both these counts, they are of paramount importance for synchronic, comparative and historical dialectology. Yet little is known of them and published materials remain scanty. It is the purpose of this article to describe in some detail the morphology of the verb, i.e., the stem, the subject markers and the object pronouns, and in the process, present phonological features and processes, in a dialect spoken in the North of the Najd, specifically that of Hāyil. This is an important town on the edge of the Jabal Shammar mountains just south of the Nafud, and some 350 miles to the north-west of Riyādh. Although the dialect manifests features which are typically Najdi, in the sense that investigation shows them to exist in other dialects of the Najd, it also possesses peculiarities all its own.","1979","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","467-499","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(biblid:abboud_1979_3244)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:morphology; vt:lexicon; reg:Arabian Peninsula [22.36, 46.81]; reg:Saudi Arabia [22.95, 46.34]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4C9D6NVM","thesis","2001","Tamari, Emad Ahmed al-","Sentential negation in English and Arabic: A minimalist approach","","","","","","This dissertation presents an analysis for sentential negation in English and Arabic within the framework of the Minimalist Program as outlined in Chomsky (1993, 1995). To provide a comprehensive analysis for sentential negation in Arabic, six Arabic dialects are studied, namely, Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, Jordanian Arabic, Syrian Arabic, and Saudi Arabic. The analysis is also expected to be applied crosslinguistically. The analysis I provide is based on the analyses suggested by Pollock (1989) and Chomsky (1991) for English and French. I show that the movement of the verb and subject in Arabic (as proposed for English and French) is triggered by the strength of the nominal ([+D]) and verbal ( [+V]) features that the heads of AgrS P and TP carry. I also show that Agr S plays a role in the word order in Standard Arabic but not in the non-Standard Arabic dialects. Evidence presented in this study shows the verb moves overtly to T in all Arabic dialects. To account for the optionality of the subject's movement in the non- Standard Arabic dialects, I suggest a third value of strength of the nominal features of T, [-strong, -weak], which means that the nominal features are not strong enough to force the movement of the subject before Spell-out or weak enough to prevent it. To account for the merger between the verb and the negative marker, I argue, along with Benmamoun (2000), that Neg is specified for a [+D] feature and the merger is to check this feature. With respect to copular sentences in English, I argue that they are best described as small clauses that are dominated by an AgrP. The place I suggest for the copula is the head of vp, which is a functional projection that dominates AgrP. I show that copular and verbless sentences in Arabic can be accounted for in a principled way if we follow the proposed structure for the English copular sentences. One difference between the two languages is that in Arabic the head of AgrP dominating the small clause can be occupied by an agreement pronoun (AGR), which may surface optionally or obligatorily.","2001","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Kansas","","","","","","","","","(biblid:tamari_2001_4039)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:syntax; vt:transcribed texts; vt:linguistics/dialectology; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HFWMVMGP","thesis","1995","Shoul, Mostafa","Etude phonologique et acoustique de l'arabe du maroc oriental","","","","","","Dans la presente these, il est question d'une etude a deux volets du parler arabe de la region orientale du Maroc. Dans les trois premiers chapitres, il s'agit d'une etude phonologique et dans le quatrieme et dernier chapitre, d'une analyse acoustique qui vient consolider la premiere etude. L'objectif de ce travail consiste a degager le systeme phonologique de l'arabe marocain dont une partie, certaines voyelles en particulier, demeure le point de litige chez les linguistes. En effet, en plus de quelques types de consonnes qui ne sont analyses ici que d'une facon accessoire, un certain nombre de voyelles se voit attribuer le statut phonologique par quelques analystes ou refuser ce meme statut par d'autres. Il s'agit des voyelles classees comme longues et, surtout, des voyelles connues comme (ultra) brieves ou centrales (e et u) sur lesquelles la presente etude se penche avec plus ou moins de detail pour essayer de trancher la question. Pour ce faire, une approche theorique et methodologique fonctionnaliste a ete adoptee. Dans la partie phonologique, il y a eu recours au test de paires minimales, de plus, concernant les cas litigieux, pour les consonnes comme pour les voyelles, les systemes proposes par les auteurs consultes ont ete compares et critiques avant que ne soit avance celui de l'auteur du present travail, soutenu par des arguments phonologiques, morphologiques et diachroniques, le cas echeant. Pour verifier l'hypothese de la presence physique de e et u, d'une part, et leurs traits caracteristiques proposes dans la partie phonologique d'autre part, une analyse acoustique a ete jugee appropriee. Celle-ci a effectivement confirme, en partie, les resultats auxquels a abouti l'etude phonologique. En gros, le systeme phonologique de l'arabe marocain selon le present travail est comme suit. En ce qui concerne les consonnes, il n'a pas ete question de viser les segments necessairement a titre individuel, mais, pour les besoins de l'etude, il suffisait de considerer les consonnes en tant que classes naturelles. Il en a ete conclu qu'en plus des consonnes dites ordinaires et des quelques consonnes dites emphatiques, il fallait considerer le reste des consonnes phonetiquement emphatiques comme des phonemes, sinon en acte, du moins en puissance, pour completer la classe, et, d'autre part, ajouter au rang des phonemes potentiels les consonnes labialisees. De la facon dont on voit le systeme consonantique depend le systeme vocalique. Ainsi, selon le point de vue adopte, il ressort que les phonemes vocaliques sont au nombre de cinq, divises en deux sous-systemes: 3 voyelles pleines ou peripheriques a, u, i decrites phonologiquement comme non-centralisees et 2 voyelles breves ou centrales e et u decrites comme centralisees. Les voyelles centralisees qui sont bien attestees par les resultats acoustiques justifient que l'on ait accorde un statut particulier aux consonnes syllabiques dans cette etude.","1995","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université Laval (Canada)","Laval","","","","","","","","(biblid:shoul_1995_3999)","","","","vt:phonology; vt:Maghreb; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FERLQ8VQ","thesis","1981","Sayed, Abdelrahman Ahmed","The Phonology of Moroccan Arabic: A Generative Phonological Approach","","","","","","This study presents a comprehensive phonological analysis of the urban dialect group of Moroccan Arabic within the framework of the standard theory of generative phonology and subsequent revisions of that theory. The phonological processes covered in the study include: assimilation, labialization, vowel epenthesis, vowel elision, stress, and emphasis. The study consists of six chapters. The first chapter introduces the basic background information about the dialect, and the second chapter deals with the phonological and morphological components. Chapter 3 through Chapter 5 deals with the phonological processes. In Chaper 3, besides the analysis of labialization, three types of assimilation are presented. These include: /1-/ assimilation, voicing assimilation, and incontiguous assimilation. The analysis of these processes provides strong supporting evidence in favor of the adjacency identity constraint as well as simultaneous rule application. Chapter 4 deals with the problem of the underlying representation of morphemes. This problem involves two phonological processes, i.e., vowel epenthesis and vowel elision. Four theoretical possibilities are proposed for representing the underlying forms, and the analysis shows that a choice based on the strong naturalness condition as well as on empirical evidence is impossible; therefore, the final choice among these possibilities is motivated by theoretical principles. In Chapter 5 stress and emphasis are analyzed. Stress always occurs on the syllable that contains a long vowel, otherwise it occurs on the penultima in three syllable words, or on the ultima in bysyllabic words. As for emphasis, the analysis results in the motivation of the feature + emphatic, the limitation of the primary emphatics to the segments / t/, /d/, /s/, and the consideration of the syllable as the domain of emphasis spread. Chapter 6 presents a summary of the phonological components, processes, and the rules which are analyzed in the study.","1981","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","The University of Texas at Austin","Austin","","","","","","","","(biblid:sayed_1981_4501)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:phonology; vt:Maghreb; vt:description of dialect; vt:transcribed texts; vt:conversation/dialogue; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"EHPP7I4G","thesis","1993","Russell, Ronald Kevin","A constraint-based approach to phonology and morphology","","","","","","It is argued that the work in phonology and morphology traditionally done by rules (extrinsically ordered or not) can be done as well if not better by constraints alone, applying in a non-derivational way to a single level of phonological representation. It is assumed that constraints cannot be ordered, but a representation must satisfy all of them simultaneously in order to be legal. Furthermore, morphemes are simply constraints on legal pairings of phonological, syntactic, and semantic information. It is proposed that phonological representations consist of nodes that (potentially) represent constriction gestures (cf. Browman and Goldstein, Gorecka), within a suprasegmental structure that incorporates the ideas of asymmetric dependency relations and empty positions from Dependency Phonology and Government Phonology. A formal language for the expression of constraints is presented and applied to a number of phenomena that have been of interest to phonologists: e.g., prosodic theory, vowel harmony, reduplication. Morphology is examined as the set of principles that determines the possible association of complex syntactic and phonological objects. Various kinds of morpheme combination (e.g., pure concatenation, infixation, templatic morphology) are shown to result from the interaction of a handful of simple constraints. The proposals concerning phonology and morphology are illustrated by analyzing the placement and deletion of determiner clitics in Nisgha (Tsimshianic, British Columbia) and epenthesis, syncope, and templatic morphology in Moroccan Arabic.

"2Q9553GE","thesis","1995","Potter, Terrence Michael","A study of Moroccan Arabic address: Findings to support the development of communicative instructional materials for Arabic","","","","","","While instructional materials for the teaching of Arabic as foreign language have begun to reflect greater communicative emphasis, there is clearly a continuing need to emphasize sociolinguistic and cultural information content to support language learning for communication. Authentic spoken Arabic language is where such content may be found. Address terms (ATs) in Moroccan Arabic (MA), as employed by native speakers and as portrayed in a sample of instructional materials, are the object of investigation in this study. An interdisciplinary approach is employed to analyze L1 data in MA and to evaluate a sample of instructional materials in Arabic. Observed and reported AT data are compared with AT presentation in both Modern Standard and Moroccan Arabic materials. A qualitative sociolinguistic analysis of ATs in use reveals patterns and variation according to addressee and speaker variables. The comparison reveals basic differences between their authentic use and current textbook representation. A critical review of textbooks and grammars indicates communicative shortcomings in view of the frequency and nature of the ATs in actual use. Successive chapters lay out the framework of descriptive analysis. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on communicative competence and communicative language teaching, the sociolinguistic study of address, and Arabic language materials. Chapter 3 describes the interdisciplinary approach to research design and analysis adopted. Chapter 4 reports the results of the sociolinguistic analysis of ATs in use. Chapter 5 is a critical review of the instructional materials sample. Chapter 6 proposes a communicative framework that includes ATs and activities for the learning of ATs, and recommends their integration into new and revised materials. In addition to providing original sociolinguistic information about MA modes of address, this descriptive analysis discloses the sociocultural added value of studying language in use, and demonstrates the need to present such information to learners. Analysis supports the development of communicatively-oriented materials that combine dedicated instruction and interactive use of ATs, as well as other functional aspects of language, to support the learning of Arabic for communication.","1995","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-08-24 07:13:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgetown University","Washington D.C.","","","","","","","","(biblid:potter_1995_3922)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"E8FRDKXS","thesis","2003","Nour, Taibi","Aspects of Tetouani Moroccan Arabic lexical morphology and phonology","","","","","","This dissertation contributes to the field of Semitic linguistics by providing a formal analysis of the phonology and morphology of Tetouani Moroccan Arabic (TMA) within the framework of Lexical Phonology (LP), exploring the implications of the data for this theory. It is based on the premise that constraints and rule types are better handled if the theory provides for a morphological component. The present study is divided into four chapters. Chapter I situates TMA in the context of the major conclusions and findings of previous researchers. Chapter II addresses some theoretical questions within LP, Feature Geometry (FG) and metrical theory. In chapter III, morphophonemic alternations and underlying forms are examined and rules formulated. Motivation for the different lexical strata is offered and a preliminary look at the postlexical level is undertaken. Chapter four covers morphology and its close connection with phonology. All the phenomena in this chapter are treated with special emphasis on their relevance to phonological processes in the language. While this dissertation is not designed to compare theoretical frameworks or evaluate their analytical parameters, it relies heavily on the insights of LP and other compatible theoretical constructs such as FG. It is possible to provide a straightforward descriptive account for the morphology and phonology of TMA with three strata. Stratum 1 contains the sound structures of base-generated segments, underived lexical items, melody assignment principles, inherent bearers of morphological markers and exceptions. These work in tandem with stress rules, pharyngealization spreading rules and other phonological adjustment rules that ""restore"" flawed strings. Stratum 2 consists of derivational templates that limit the number of possible paradigms in TMA. Stratum 3 supplies the last, most productive and least problematic processes and rules including phonetic interpretation rules. One working principle is that there is a close connection between processes, representations, and constraints. Constraints are needed to account for TMA, and LP provides for that. Phonological processes are harnessed by the targets that are set and parametrized by constraints. Rules partially restore grammaticality to phonological strings at different levels and partially harmonize complex architectural conflicts after tier conflation.","2003","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Madison","Madison","","","","","","","","(biblid:nour_2003_3899)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:phonology; vt:urban dialect; vt:Maghreb; vt:morphology; vt:lexicon; vt:transcribed texts; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; geo:Tétouan [35.58, -5.36]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"4EWTAB9W","thesis","1996","Nouhi, Youssef","Wh-constructions in Moroccan Arabic","","","","","","This thesis is designed to study various Moroccan Arabic (MA) wh- constructions both within the Government and Binding (GB) framework and the Minimalist Program (MP). It is, specifically, confined to relative clause formation, left dislocation (topicalization) and questions. A detailed analysis of relative clause formation is provided. It is particularly argued that the resumptive pronoun insertion in relatives is a last resort strategy which is used only where movement fails. It is also shown that resumptive pronouns function as variables which are bound by null operators in LF. In the course of this analysis, the issues of the Binding Theory and of the A$\sp\prime$-disjointness requirement with respect to resumptive pronouns are also discussed. Subsequently, an examination of yes-no questions is given. Additionally, Cheng's (1991) generalization that the availability of question particles correlates with the lack of syntactic wh-movement is investigated in detail. Finally, the recent minimalist version (Chomsky 1995) is applied to the issue of optionality in word orders and to certain wh-constructions.

"KKQ85SXM","thesis","1994","Miller, Amanda","Language indexation: A syntactic constraint on code-mixing","","","","","","Code-mixing, defined as intra-sentential language alternation, is known to demonstrate structurally determined patterns of restriction. Universal constraints have been proposed to account for these structural restrictions (Poplack (1980), Woolford (1983), Di Sciullo, Muysken and Singh (1986)) but have had limited success in accounting for code-mixing between typologically diverse languages. This thesis examines the structural principles that apply universally to the interaction of languages in code-mixed sentences. We argue that systematic cross- linguistic restrictions on code-mixing can be accounted for by a syntactic constraint that is sensitive to the distinction between functional and lexical categories. We propose the constraint of Language Indexation, according to which (structurally) adjacent categories of like functional/lexical category status must be realised in the same language. We show how this proposal accounts for code-mixed data from a range of language pairs, including Tagalog/English, Moroccan Arabic/French, Swahili/English, Irish/English, Hindi/English, Spanish/English and French/English. A difference in the application of Language Indexation in nominal versus verbal projections is discussed with reference to Tagalog/English and Moroccan Arabic/ French code-mixing. Finally, we briefly examine the implications of Language Indexation with respect to the code-mixing of aphasic bilinguals.","1994","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","McGill University (Canada)","","","","","","","","","(biblid:miller_1994_3869)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:syntax; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:contact linguistics; vt:french language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"B47VQYWJ","thesis","1991","Lahlou, Moncef","A morpho-syntactic study of code-switching between Moroccan Arabic and French","","","","","","Code-switching, the use of two languages in the course of one speech event, has been extensively studied during the last decade, both from a functional and a structural perspective. A constantly growing number of languages has been looked at, but no systematic study has been done on code-switching between Moroccan Arabic and French. This dissertation is a step toward filling this gap. It is a study of the morpho-syntactic characteristics of code-switching as it is practiced by native speakers of Moroccan Arabic and native speakers of French. The introductory chapters lay the groundwork for the study: a description of the complex linguistic situation of the country is offered, a review of both the sociolinguistic literature on Morocco and of the literature on code-switching in general is also given; then, the theoretical question of what constitutes code-switching and what constitutes borrowing is discussed. The main result of this study is that the grammar of the first language governs code-switching. A code-switched utterance produced by a bilingual Moroccan and one produced by a French native speaker will be exact mirror images of each other. In the first case, grammatical items, such as determiners, conjunctions, and prepositions, will be drawn from Moroccan Arabic and some of the lexicon from French. The word order, when there is no correspondence in structure between the two languages, will be that imposed by Moroccan Arabic. In the second case, we find the exact opposite: the governing grammar will be French and part of the lexicon will be from Moroccan Arabic. The study also shows that code-switching does not indicate a lack of competence in either of the two languages of the bilingual code- switcher. It constitutes rather part of a complex set of social attributes which one can find with educated bilingual Moroccans. These social attributes illustrate the close link existing between language and culture in society. In many aspects of their daily life, these educated bilingual Moroccans display features which indicate their 'composite' identity. The study concludes that more 'two-way' studies of code-switching must be carried out for us to come to a better appreciation of this linguistic phenomenon. Only then, it is argued, can we develop a 'universal' theory of code-switching.","1991","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","The University of Texas at Austin","Austin","","","","","","","","(biblid:lahlou_1991_4527)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:morphology; vt:syntax; vt:transcribed texts; vt:conversation/dialogue; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:contact linguistics; vt:french language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FS7QMEAD","thesis","1998","Khabir, Moulay Ahmed","Issues in Arabic morphology and phonology: Theoretical implications","","","","","","This study is an attempt to address some problems in Arabic morphology and phonology which have serious consequences for morphological and phonological theories. As regards morphology, it is argued in contradistinction to orthodox treatments that roots and patterns are not appropriate for Arabic word formation, and that the so-called Semitic root is not the basic unit of lexical organisation as it has traditionally been assumed. Several arguments are adduced to support this claim. First it is shown that the concept of a consonantal (mostly triliteral) root without vowels is a legacy of Sanskrit-based Boppian methodology that was latter taken up by Western grammarians and Structurialists alike in their analyses of Arabic grammar after a long tradition in which the basic unit had been the verbum pefectum . It is shown that the theoretical mutation that resulted from this did not go unquestioned. Several kinds of evidence that the root is at most a fictitious entity that has no reality outside the words in which it exists are adduced. Further evidence is based on the late Arab grammarians' views of the organisation of morphology in which word formation is not a simple association of roots and patterns. It is also shown that the pattern system is not relevant to morphology because of its erosion in so many Semitic and Arabic dialects alike. We conclude that Arabic confirms the validity of the Word-Based Hypothesis. The status of morphological alternations is also examined on the basis of Moroccan Arabic nominal plurals. It is argued that a unified treatment of morphophonology is inadequate. We propose instead an account in which automatic alternations belong in the phonology, and non-automatic alternations in the morphology along the lines of the Integrated Theory of Phonology and Morphology of Ford and Singh. In phonology it is argued in line with the principles of Generative Phonotactics that generalisations can be successfully expressed without recourse to the mechanisms called rules. It is shown that rules are problematic devices because of their excessive power and arbitrariness. We propose instead that surface generalisations can be captured in terms of the principles of metrical organisation together with a set of tactics (WFCs) which act as triggers of phonological repair strategies whenever violations of the tactics arise. we offer an analysis of the phonological behaviour of MA triliteral verbal and nominal morphology which confirms these views.","1998","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Université de Montreal (Canada)","Montreal","","","","","","","","(biblid:khabir_1998_3757)","","","","vt:phonology; vt:Maghreb; vt:morphology; vt:transcribed texts; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"VWRT9BSU","thesis","1986","Keegan, John Michael","The Phonology and Morphology of Moroccan Arabic","","","","","","This study thoroughly describes the phonological and morphological processes of Moroccan Arabic within the general framework of generative theory. The goal has been to provide a comprehensive, formal analysis of the Moroccan data, while providing an abundance of sample alternations, derivations, and paradigms for use by subsequent researchers. Since the thesis is broad in scope, it has been necessary to examine a wide spectrum of theoretical issues. First, this study proposes an expansion of metrical theory in which the metrical structure of words is viewed as a constraint on the output of phonological rules. Secondly, the study challenges the standard generative view of morphology–that the word constitutes the base for regular morphological processes. Instead, evidence is provided that in Moroccan Arabic it is the morpheme (or root) which actually constitutes the base for all morphological processes.","1986","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","City University of New York","New York","","","","","","","","(biblid:keegan_1986_4503)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:phonology; vt:Maghreb; vt:description of dialect; vt:morphology; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"U4S4J7VD","thesis","1987","Idrissi-Bouyahyaoui, Bouchaib","Metalinguistic Awareness in Literate and Illiterate Children and Adults: A Psycholinguistic Study","","","","","","Available from UMI in association with The British Library. Requires signed TDF. The primary concern of this thesis was to elucidate the processes underlying certain aspects of metalinguistic awareness and to trace their relationship to advances in maturation and acquisition of literacy. The guiding principle has been to determine how much of what has been considered normal cognitive development is in fact an age-round developmental phenomenon, or to what extent it reflects the result of experiences associated with the degree and extent of literacy. The need for this is apparent on examining previous research which, as we demonstrate, has confounded such theoretically important variables as Age, Literacy and peculiarities of the native language. The aim of the methodology employed here was to deconfound such variables and add more insight as to the nature of metalinguistic abilities. First, by employing literate and illiterate children and adults, the design optimizes the likelihood of tapping a precise relationship between maturation, literacy and metalinguistic awareness. Second, by using native speakers of Arabic, the general design offers the opportunity to add insight from yet another language typologically different from English in which most previous research was conducted. Third, by employing more than one type of linguistic measure for the same population, the design also hopes to answer one empirical question, namely, whether metalinguistic awareness can be conceptualised as either multidimensional or unitary in nature. The Subjects who participated in the study were 120 Moroccan Arabic speaking literate and illiterate children and adults drawn from a relatively homogeneous socio-economic background. A total of seven experiments–some with subtasks–were used. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 form the main bulk of the research. Using various experiments, they examine the extent to which Ss deploy their metalinguistic knowledge in the process of attending to and manipulating the following linguistic units: (i) word (Chapter 3); (ii) syllables (Chapter 4); (iii) segments (Chapter 5). Typically, each one of these chapters considers various hypotheses and research questions which concern the specific linguistic unit. Finally, Chapter 6 draws general conclusions from the general study and addresses some implications for linguistic theory, psycholinguistic research and, although not extensively, education research.

"AZ3WV2CW","thesis","1993","Horie, Kaoru","A cross-linguistic study of perception and cognition verb complements: A cognitive perspective","","","","","","This study represents a cross-linguistic comparison of cognition and perception verb complements in a selected set of European and non- European languages including English, French, German, Russian, Cambodian, Japanese, and Moroccan Arabic. It explores the tendency to encode Directly Perceived Events and Indirectly Perceived Events by means of different types of complement constructions. The study undertakes an in-depth comparison of four selected languages, viz. English, Modern Japanese, Korean and Classical Japanese, in terms of the way these languages encode through nominalization the ontological distinction and interface among physical objects, Directly Perceived Events and Indirectly Perceived Events. It is observed that languages resort to such linguistic devices as (non)finiteness, different complementizers/nominalizers, and nominalizations of differing nominal status to encode the ontological and cognitive differences. What emerges from the cross-linguistic comparison is a close relationship between form and meaning of complements and nominalization in encoding the cognitive and ontological distinctions. This study concludes that the choice of various linguistic devices is motivated by two cognitive principles, iconicity and grammaticalization. Iconicity (form-meaning interaction) accounts for the cross-linguistic tendency for Directly Perceived Events and Indirectly Perceived Events to be encoded by non-finite and finite clauses respectively. It also explains the correlation between the conceptual and syntactic complexity of nominalized expressions used to encode the distinction among physical objects, Directly Perceived Events and Indirectly Perceived Events. Grammaticalization (the diachronic process through which lexical words are semantically bleached and become function words) is instrumental to our understanding of why words with particular lexical meaning are chosen as complementizers/nominalizers which encode particular ontological entities. This study has thus presented a possible research area in which Cognitive Linguistics and Syntactic Typology can profit from each other.

"H5FFIKLK","thesis","2005","Hachimi, Atiqa","Dialect leveling, maintenance and urban identity in Morocco Fessi immigrants in Casablanca","","","","","","In Morocco today two competing local urban models co-exist. On one hand, there are the Old urban dialects of the historical cities, which have defined urban and prestigious linguistic practice in Morocco for centuries. These dialects have acted as badges of a well-established urban and bourgeois identity. On the other hand, there are the newly formed koinés that have emerged as a result of massive internal migration to large urban centres in the 20th century. These koinés are establishing themselves as new urban dialects and are shaping a new brand of urban identity. The best representatives of these types of dialects and identities in contemporary Morocco are, without doubt, Fessi (from the city of Fez) and Casablancan (from the city of Casablanca), respectively. This study examines the social and linguistic outcomes of the Fessi- Casablancan contact, considering in particular how Fessi women of Andalusian descent construct linguistic and social identity in Casablanca. Data come from in-depth ethnographic interviews that I have carried out with migrant (first generation) and Casablanca-born (second and third generation) Fessis during a 14-month period of fieldwork in 1999-2000 in Casablanca. Three linguistic variables are examined in order to assess Fessi women's leveling or maintenance of Fessi forms: two phonological variables; the alveolar trill variable (r) and the uvular stop variable (q), and one morphosyntactic variable; the second person singular feminine clitic (-i). Drawing on the latest research on language and identity which emphasizes the agency of speakers in constructing their own identities (e.g., Eckert 2000; Gubbins and Holt 2002), the study identifies the categories that have emerged as a result of the Fessi-Casablancan contact such as 'pure Fessis', 'Fessi-Casablancans' and 'Casablancans'. The study then goes beyond identifying categories to looking at the linguistic and non- linguistic practices that are used to construct and give meaning to these identities. The findings of this study show that sounding 'normal', i.e., leveling out stereotypical regional traits, becoming 'tough', and being 'one of the folks, not snob' are important components in thinning out 'pure Fessi' identity. These practices may also be considered rites of passage to becoming 'Fessi-Casablancan' or 'Casablancan'.","2005","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Hawai'i","","","","","","","","","(biblid:hachimi_2005_3671)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:urban dialect; vt:Maghreb; vt:sociolinguistics; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; geo:Casablanca [33.57, -7.58]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"F9M3SFIU","thesis","2008","Ennamsaoui, M.","L'alternance locative en arabe marocain et en arabe standard","","","","","","L'alternance locative implique la possibilité pour certains verbes locatifs de réaliser syntaxiquement leurs arguments différemment. Un verbe comme to load , en anglais, permet que le constituant Locatum et le constituant Lieu soient réalisés dans la position d'objet direct alternativement, nommément une construction standard, où le Locatum occupe la position d'objet direct et le Lieu la position d'objet oblique et la construction croisée où le Lieu occupe la position d'objet direct et le Locatum la position d'objet oblique. Cette thèse examine les verbes locatifs en arabe marocain et en arabe standard dans une perspective sémantique. Trois types de verbes ont été identifiés: des verbes standards, des verbes croisés et des verbes alternants. Les deux variantes de l'arabe partagent plusieurs traits communs avec l'anglais et le franÃ§ais, ils ont par contre quelques particularités qui se conforment, par ailleurs, aux généralisations théoriques. Au terme de cette étude, nous avons conclu que la possibilité pour un verbe d'alterner est contrainte par le sens du verbe et la possibilité pour celui-ci de prédire un changement de Lieu ou un changement d'état. Il a été montré que seuls les verbes d'activité ont ce potentiel d'alterner sous réserve que la condition sus-mentionnée soit satisfaite. Le sens du verbe est de ce fait capital pour déterminer et comprendre le comportement syntaxique des verbes. Mots clés : Alternance locative, structure argumentale, arabe marocain, arabe standard.","2008","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Ottawa (Canada)","Ottawa","","","","","","","","(biblid:ennamsaoui_2008_3616)","","","","vt:Maghreb; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:diglossia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TG3MQJZH","thesis","2001","Boudlal, Abdelaziz","Constraint Interaction in the Phonology and Morphology of Casablanca Moroccan Arabic","","","","","","http://linguistlist.org/pubs/diss/browse-diss-action.cfm?DissID=4933 (09.03.2010) The objective of this dissertation is to account for some aspects of the prosodic phonology and morphology of Casablanca Moroccan Arabic within the framework of Optimality Theory as conceived in Prince and Smolensky (1993) and McCarthy and Prince (1993a) and developed in the Correspondence model of McCarthy and Prince (1995, 1999) and other related works. It is shown that a division must be established between two types of syllables: a major syllable whose nucleus is one a schwa or one of the full vowels [i, u, a], and a minor syllable which consists solely of a moraic consonant. Granting a moraic status to this consonant is allowed for the purpose of achieving the foot binarity requiring, especially in nonderived trisegmental words on the pattern CCV, CCəC or CəCC, where the first consonant of the initial cluster and the second consonant of the final cluster form minor syllables on their own. The fact that the schwa is epenthesized before the final consonant of nonderived trisegmental verbs, adjectives and a class of nouns follows from the requirement that the right edge of the stem be aligned with a prominent syllable, which corresponds to a major syllable. The nominal class showing the CəCC pattern is shown to abide by markedness constraints favoring schwa syllables with a higher sonority coda. The dissertation also offers an adequate analysis of the problematic cases of cyclic schwa syllabification in terms of a subset of output-output constraints, one of which demanding phonological identity between a derived form and its morphologically-related base form. The theoretical framework herein conceptualized gives a straightforward answer to the puzzling stress system of the language which shows both trochaic and iambic feet. In particular, it is argued that in both isolation words, where the foot is trochaic and context words, where the foot is iambic, the location of stress and consequently the foot types that emerge depend on the hierarchical organization of prosodic words into phonological phrases. A unitary account of the stress system is offered to the effect that both trochaic and iambic feet occur in the language. Trochaic feet surface as optimal when the word is in isolation (i.e. when it is a phonological phrase); iambic feet arise when the word is in context . The dissertation also argues that morphological classes such as the causative, the passive participle and the diminutive are governed by a prosodic constraint requiring that their output be an iambic foot. The causative form, which has previously been analyzed as involving prosodic circumscription, is now reanalyzed as a case of partial reduplication which can be accounted for by constraints demanding correspondence between the base and its reduplicant. In particular it is shown the constraint calling for an iamb consisting of a sequence of two light syllables takes priority over the constraint on the base and reduplicant identity and therefore block total reduplication. The passive participle and the diminutive are two instances that resort to augmentation to achieve an iambic foot type. In the case of the passive participle, it is argued that the prefinal vowel that appears in certain classes of non derived verbs is the result of the constraint requiring that the output conform to an iambic foot consisting of a sequence of light and heavy syllables. In case where augmentation would lead to the violation of higher-ranked constraints, the optimal foot that emerges consists of a sequence of two light syllables. In the case of the diminutive, if augmentation applies, it is for the sole purpose of achieving a light-light foot. Augmentation itself takes tow different forms: either by the addition of schwa syllables to words that are masculine, or by the suffixation of the feminine morpheme to words which are inherently feminine.","2001","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mohammed V University - Agdal","","","","","","","","","(biblid:boudlal_2001_4183)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:phonology; vt:Maghreb; vt:description of dialect; vt:morphology; vt:transcribed texts; vt:linguistics/dialectology; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; geo:Casablanca [33.57, -7.58]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QSUMJL7B","thesis","1992","Bergman, Elizabeth M.","What the old ones said: The syntax of the Moroccan Arabic proverb","","","","","","This study examines the grammatical structure of the Moroccan Arabic proverb. The hypothesis of this study is that grammatical structures of proverbs differ from those of non-proverbial discourse. Such structural differences may provide a set of templates or models for the formation of proverbs or serve as distinctive features that differentiate proverbial from non-proverbial utterances. The corpus of data consists of some 250 previously published Moroccan Arabic proverbs. The structures examined are sentence structure, noun phrase structure, verb use and negational structures. These grammatical structures are discussed, first, as they are described in the literature on non-proverbial Moroccan Arabic and, second, as they occur in the corpus. Then, differences between the structures of the corpus and those of non-proverbial Moroccan Arabic are examined. The findings of this study confirm the hypothesis, that proverbs exhibit grammatical structures that differ from those of non-proverbial discourse. The noun phrase structures that occur most frequently in non- proverbial Moroccan Arabic are found only infrequently in the corpus; those that occur in the corpus are, instead, are short, non-specific, and shared with Classical and Modern Standard Arabic. The negative structures of the corpus are a hybrid of those found in Moroccan Arabic and those more usually associated with Classical and Modern Standard Arabic. And the use of verb forms in the corpus more closely resembles that of Classical and Modern Standard Arabic than that of non-proverbial Moroccan Arabic. Moroccan Arabic proverbs, thus, appear to constitute or be part of a middle register of Arabic, with features of a predominantly oral language variety, Moroccan Arabic, as well as those of literate varieties, Classical and Modern Standard Arabic. The fact that a quintessentially oral genre like the proverb contains syntactic features of literate language can be explained in terms of the original hypothesis, that such features differentiate proverbs from non- proverbial utterances. At the same time, however, it appears through the use of these features, proverbs evoke the legitimacy and prestige of Classical and Modern Standard Arabic, the language varieties used by religious and secular authorities in Morocco.","1992","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-07-19 18:23:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan","Ann Arbor","","","","","","","","(biblid:bergman_1992_4400)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:description of dialect; vt:sociolinguistics; vt:transcribed texts; vt:linguistics/dialectology; vt:proverbs; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:ethnography; vt:folklore; vt:oral literature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QNIIGR5I","thesis","1992","Benmamoun, Elabbas","Inflectional and Functional Morphology: Problems of Projection, Representation and Derivation","","","","","","This dissertation investigates the properties of functional and inflectional categories such as tense, agreement, negation and question morphemes. Two central issues are discussed. The first issue revolves around the problem of projection, representation and derivation of these categories. The second issue focuses on the effects of the interaction between these morphemes and the categories they relate to or license (such as Negative Polarity Items, Wh-phrases, Subject agreement). Much of the data come from Standard Arabic and Moroccan Arabic in addition to English and French. Conceptual and empirical arguments are given to substantiate the claim that inflectional and functional morphemes and particularly Tense, Agreement and Negation should be projected independently of the predicate. Moreover, it is argued that, in accordance with the Strict Projectionist Hypothesis, each morpheme occupies its own independent projection. As far as the problem of derivation is concerned it is argued on conceptual grounds that derivation of inflectional categories is subject to minimality. The same categories that block derivation of inflectional morphemes seem to block other relations (binding and antecedent government) that involve maximal projections. For example, negation blocks verb movement and seems to interact with extraction and binding. This provides a general account for failure of verb movement to tense in the context of the sentential negative laa in Standard Arabic and for the same effects in the context of Neg and Qu in English. What is specific to head movement is its sensitivity to the morphological status of the intervening categories. The solutions provided to the problems of projection, representation and derivation suggest possible accounts for some asymmetries that characterize the relation between certain functional morphemes and the categories they are related to or they license. For example, it is observed that preverbal NPI subjects, argued to be licensed under Spec- head agreement, are not allowed in languages like Standard Arabic and English while they are possible in Moroccan Arabic. Similarly, extraction of subjects in English and French does not trigger Do-support and Complex Inversion while extraction of complements and adjuncts does.

"U2F9QMKW","thesis","1983","Badry, Fatima","Acquisition of Lexical Derivational Rules in Moroccan Arabic: Implications for the Developement of Standard Arabic as a Second Language through Literacy","","","","","","This research investigated the development and organization of derivational rules governing the acquisition of the lexicon in Moroccan Arabic as a native dialect. The Arabic lexicon is based on a system of underlying consonantal roots that combine with surface patterns to form most content words. The study examined the role of semantic and formal properties in the process of analyzing Arabic words into patterns and underlying roots at different developmental stages. It also addressed the question of how strategies developed by Moroccan children in learning their native dialect could be utilized in teaching Standard Arabic in a school setting. It was hypothesized that: (1) the underlying consonantal root plays a central role both semantically and morphologically in the acquisition of the Arabic lexical derivational rules; (2) Arabic speaking children develop two major derivational strategies, which are referred to here as vertical and horizontal derivations, in the process of acquiring their lexicon. To test these hypotheses a battery of tasks designed to provide linguistic evidence were administered to 40 middle-class Moroccan children, between the ages of 3;5 and 9;9, enrolled in a private school in Casablanca, Morocco. Data were collected by means of six tasks: elicited interview, story-retelling, verbal and nominal patterns production and comprehension tasks. Each child was individually tested in four sessions over a seven week period. Data were audio-recorded and later transcribed. The errors of misformed patterns and metathesis, in addition to children's ability to derive innovative forms filling lexical gaps, were interpreted as evidence that Moroccan children develop derivational rules which allow them to use the system productively around the age of 3;5. Findings supported the prediction that the process of acquiring the Arabic lexicon follows a developmental curve which consists of four main stages: (1) the child uses words as rote learned forms; (2) the child discovers that some words which express a common meaning component also share the same pattern frames. This discovery results from advanced conceptual development and an expanded input that allow him to see that newly abstracted concepts are expressed by similar frames; (3) he abstracts the shared consonantal root from several patterns derived from it and is able to coin words by a vertical derivation rule; . . .

"788UVPP5","thesis","1997","Amakhmakh, Naceur","Nonlinear phonology of a Moroccan Arabic dialect","","","","","","This study is primarily concerned with the phonology of one Moroccan Arabic dialect, spoken in and around Sefrou in the centre of Morocco. The main goal of this dissertation is to describe several aspects of the phonology and morphology of Moroccan Arabic in terms of autosegmental phonology. The main body of the dissertation is divided into five chapters. Chapter one outlines the framework of nonlinear phonology with some of its subcomponents in which this study is undertaken, and gives a brief description of the dialect under investigation. Chapter two analyzes various assimilatory processes that target mainly coronal consonants (e.g. definite article assimilation, prefix /t- / voicing assimilation, coronal sonorant assimilation, and long-distance assimilation of fricatives). It also examines the process of labialization. Chapter three gives an acoustic correlation of pharyngealization on vowels and examines the domain of pharyngealization spread within the word with the aim of establishing whether the domain of pharyngealization spread is morphologically determined or phonologically determined. In chapter four, two morphological operations are examined (the diminutive formation and one of the broken plural patterns), following McCarthy's insight (1979, 1981) and McCarthy and Prince (1990) among others. Both these morphological operations are based on the stem mapped onto an underlying template /C$\sb\rm I$ u C$\sb2$ i C$\sb3\ \partial$ C$\sb\rm F/$ (for the diminutive) and /C$\sb\rm I$ C$\sb2$ a C$\sb3\ \partial$ C$\sb\rm F/$ (for the broken plural). Chapter five summarizes the findings of the study.","1997","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","The University of Wisconsin","Madison","","","","","","","","(biblid:amakhmakh_1997_3312)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:phonology; vt:Maghreb; vt:description of dialect; vt:transcribed texts; vt:linguistics/dialectology; vt:conversation/dialogue; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; geo:Sefrou [33.83, -4.83]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"P4CF4ISH","thesis","1982","Aftat, Mokhtar","The Acquisition of Negation and WH-Questins in a Moroccan Arabic speaking four-year-old child","","","","","","A longitudinal investigation of aspects of a child's systems of Moroccan Arabic negation and wh-questions was carried out when the child was between ages 3; 0 and 4; 0. The data were based on samples of both spontaneous and elicited speech. The analysis included syntactic, semantic, functional, and cognitive aspects of language development. The results indicated that the syntax of the subject's utterances involving negation was similar to the adult model although, occasionally, she adopted grammatical strategies that resulted in unusual negative sentences. The dominant negative structure she produced was /ma — s (i)/. In her embedded sentences, she negated the matrix S in the sentence. Her negative utterances (a) negated the propositional content of affirmative sentences, (b) negated physical actions, and (c) were a comment on affirmatives. Her language functions were also similar to the adult model, and were of both a unifunctional and a multifunctional nature. These were expressed through kinesics and paralinguistic features. The subject's production of wh-questions was grammatically correct, i.e., the pattern was wh-word + S + rising intonation. Her wh-questions expressed various appropriate functions but, by the end of the study, mastery of language functions was not complete. The subject's comprehension of structures involving ask/tell + wh-word, and the conditional with wh-words were usually misinterpreted, as were some wh- words. These observed characteristics of her incomplete linguistic knowledge were explained in terms of (a) language complexity (syntactic, semantic, and functional), (b) cognitive development, and (c) communication skills. Frequency of occurrence was a minor contributing factor.","1982","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","The University of Texas at Austin","Austin","","","","","","","","(biblid:aftat_1982_3278)","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:Maghreb; vt:sociolinguistics; vt:transcribed texts; vt:anthropology; vt:linguistics/dialectology; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]; vt:diglossia; vt:Baby talk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Daniels, and the book rapidly became the standard reference for the phonologies of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Now the concept has been extended, and Kaye has assembled nearly 50 scholars to write essays on the morphologies of the same language group. The coverage is complete, copious, and again will likely become the standard work in the field. Contributors are an international Who's Who of Afro-Asiatic linguistics, from Appleyard to Leslau to Voigt. It is with great sadness that we report the death of Alan Kaye on May 31, 2007, while these volumes were in the final stages of preparation for the press. Alan was diagnosed with bone cancer on May 1 while on research leave in the United Arab Emirates and was brought home to Fullerton by his son on May 22.","2007","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-04-15 16:02:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","Eisenbrauns","Winona Lake, Ind","English","","","nlebk","","EBSCOhost","","(biblid:kaye_2007_2987)","","","","LANGUAGE ARTS & DISCIPLINES / Alphabets & Writing Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the section on'Phonological Perspectives'there are papers dealing with emphasis spread and with gemination/degemination/antigemination in Iraqi Arabic. The papers in the section on syntax, all focused on MSA and within a GB framework, discuss aspects of Arabic that are problematic for current hypotheses in linguistics, and also more traditional issues such as word order and verbal vs. nominal sentences. The last two papers represent a historical, comparative Semitic perspective: on the function of energic suffixes, and on the reconstruction of the early Arabic sounds represented by siin and šiin.","1993","2018-04-15 16:02:33","2018-09-18 14:28:31","","","","","","","","","Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science.

What is more, there is an increasing use of Arabic dialects in social media, so this text is now considered quite appropriate as a source of a corpus. We collected 210,915K tweets from five groups of Arabic dialects Gulf, Iraqi, Egyptian, Levantine, and North African. This paper explores Twitter as a source and describes the methods that we used to extract tweets and classify them according to the geographic location of the sender. We classified Arabic dialects by using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) data analytic tool which contains many alternative filters and classifiers for machine learning. Our approach in classification tweets achieved an accuracy equal to 79%.","2017-06","2018-04-19 12:23:58","2018-04-19 12:24:38","","37–44","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","vt:general/comparative study; vt:transcribed texts; vt:Arab World general; vt:corpora","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main issue addressed concerns the MA auxiliary kan and its English equivalent be which impose some untreated restrictions on VP-deletion. In MA, VP-deletion is always allowed when no auxiliaries are used, no matter what the tense of the sentence is. The question is what happens when auxiliaries are used. The puzzle is why VP-deletion is disallowed when VP-arguments or adjuncts are left behind. I propose that both MA and English resort to deletion of Aspect Phrase (AspP) when the presence of the aspectual marker ka-/-ing disallows VP-deletion. Evidence supplied by the distribution of place, manner, and reason adverbs, direct and indirect objects argues that what deletes after the auxiliary kan is an aspectual projection rather than VP. VP-deletion in this case is made impossible by morphological constraints imposed by kan’s complement particle ka- (ta, in some MA dialects, -ing in English). The analysis I propose here derives the restrictions on deletion with kan from independently justified morphological properties of this auxiliary. Furthermore, it explains the behavior of the similar pattern of deletion with English be...-ing. The chapter also examines other auxiliaries, in particular, the future element yadi ( and its contracted form ya), which differs from kan in that its complement cannot be deleted. I argue that this is so because the complement of yadi is an argument, albeit a propositional one, that carries a θ-role. Similar results hold for modals.","2002","2018-04-23 19:32:16","2018-04-23 19:32:16","","217-240","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Netherlands","Dordrecht","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-94-010-0351-3_8","","","","vt:Maghreb; vt:syntax; vt:transcribed texts; vt:conversation/dialogue; reg:Morocco [31.46, -6.39]","","Ouhalla, Jamal; Shlonsky, Ur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
